The amplifier control modules are designed to easily interface RTXI with several common patch clamp amplifiers. These modules adjust scaling factors to compensate for amplifier gains based on the amplifier's current settings. Depending on the capabilities of the amplifier, the module may also have additional features, such as software controlled mode changing.
