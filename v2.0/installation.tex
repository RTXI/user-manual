\section{Installation}

The following sets of instructions are provided for installation of RTXI on  Ubuntu 12.04. Other Linux distributions are compatible with RTXI and require similar steps for compiling a real-time kernel, installing Xenomai, and installing RTXI and its dependencies. To date, RTXI has been successfully installed on Ubuntu, Scientific Linux, SUSE, and Fedora. 

RTXI requires a real-time kernel, which is created by patching Xenomai on to an existing mainline kernel. Xenomai versions are compatible with specific Linux kernels. Users can choose any supported combination of Linux and Xenomai, but note that our installation media and scripts push Ubuntu 12.04.4 with the 3.8.13 kernel and 2.6.3 Xenomai patch.
