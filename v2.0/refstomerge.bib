	Abstract = {The shape of action potentials plays an important role in synaptic integration. Action potentials of different shapes shunt excitatory potentials differentially and consequently correspond to different probabilities of generating the next spike. Thus two neurons producing different spikes shapes, say Purkinje and pyramidal cells, integrate differently the same excitatory potentials. More interestingly, there is variability in the spike shape of a single neuron when stimulated dynamically, that can then also dynamically affect the synaptic integration. Our recent experiments have shown that this variability in the spike shape is not random but depends on stimulus history. Here we analyze a simple model of cortical neuron to understand the origin of this encoding of stimulus history into spike shape. We find that slow conductances, for example calcium conductances, can be responsible for this rich encoding.},

	Abstract = {Traditional techniques to stimulate neurons in Neuroscience include current injection using several protocols. In most cases, although neurons are able to react to any stimulus in the physiological range, it is difficult to assess to what extent the response is a natural output to the processing of the input or just an awkward reaction to a foreign signal. In experiments that try to study the precise temporal relationships between the stimulus and the output pattern, it is crucial to use realistic stimulation protocols. Dynamic-clamp is a relatively recent method in electrophysiology to mimic the presence of ionic or synaptic conductances in a cell membrane through the injection of a controlled current waveform. Here we present a set of advanced dynamic-clamp protocols for realistic stimulation of cells that allow from the addition of single and multiple ionic or synaptic conductances, to the reconfiguration of circuits and bidirectional communication of living cells with model neurons including plasticity mechanisms.},

By re-embodying dissociated cultured networks, network function can be mapped onto behavior, and in vitro research can now make use of a new kind of behavioral studies that include detailed (submicron) imaging not possible in vivo. By closing the sensory-motor loop around MEA cultures, they are more likely to shed light on the mechanisms of learning, memory, and information processing in animals.},
