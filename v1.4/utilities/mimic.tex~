%Mimic Module

\subsubsection{Overview}
\label{Mimic}
\index{Mimic}\index{utilities, Mimic}
The Mimic module is the simplest signal generator available in RTXI. Mimic's main function is to apply a gain and/or offset to a signal it receives. By itself, Mimic can also be used output a continuous signal.

\caption[Mimic]{Two Mimic modules are connected with their outputs displayed on the oscilloscope. Mimic-3, as shown in the blue oscilloscope trace, is outputting an offset of 1. As shown in the connector, Mimic-3's output (Vout) is connected to Mimic-14's (Vin). Mimic-14 applies the set gain and offset to Mimic-3's signal (1*2+1), resulting in an output of 4 shown in red. A tutorial is provided to replicate this figure.}

\subsubsection{Output Channels}
\begin{description}
\item [Vout]Output calculated by multiplying input signal by gain and adding offset
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Input Channels}
\begin{description}
\item [Vin]Input used in the output calculation
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Parameters}
\begin{description}
\item [Gain]Factor by which input is multipled
\item [Offset]Factor added to the input. If no input is connected (i.e. input = 0), offset solely determines output
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Tutorial}
\label{mimic tutorial}\index{Mimic, tutorial}\index{tutorial, Mimic}
In this tutorial, the aim is to replicate what is shown in Figure \ref{mimic}. Two mimic modules are used, with one outputting a continuous signal of 1, and the other taking this signal and applying a gain of 2 and offset of 1. The oscilloscope is used to visualize both signals, with the option of outputting the signal through a data acquisition board.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open two Mimic modules through the menu: \textbf{Utilities}$\rightarrow$\textbf{Signals}$rightarrow$\textbf{Mimic}
\item Open the Oscilloscope module through the menu: \textbf{System}$\rightarrow$\seealso{Chapter \ref{Oscilloscope}\\Oscilloscope}\textbf{Oscilloscope}
\item Open the Connetor Panel through the menu: \textbf{System}$\rightarrow$\seealso{Chapter \ref{Connector}\\Connector}\textbf{Connector}
\item Connect the output of one Mimic module (hereby termed Mimic-1st), to the other's (hereby termed Mimic-2nd) input \attention The numbers next to a module name in the top left of each window denote the modules ID number, and this number most likely will not be the same as in Figure \ref{mimic}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item In the output block on the left side of the \textbf{Connector Panel}, select the Mimic module being used to output the first signal (Mimic-1st). The channel option should default to its only option, \textbf{Vout}
  \item In the input block on the right side of the \textbf{Connector Panel}, select the other Mimic module (Mimic-2nd). The channel option should default to its only option, \textbf{Vin}
  \end{itemize}
\item Set up the oscilloscope to visualize both outputs of the Mimic module by right clicking on the oscilloscope and selecting \textbf{Properties}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Make sure the \textbf{Channel} Tab is currently selected
  \item Select the Mimic module corresponding to Mimic-1st under the channel pulldown menu
  \item Select \textbf{Output} in the following pulldown menu, and make sure \textbf{Vout} is the selected output
  \item Activate the channel by hitting the toggle button \textbf{Active}
  \item Change the scale to \textbf{1 V/div} in the Scale pulldown menu
  \item Change the color to \textbf{Blue}
  \item Click the \textbf{Apply} button to save the changes
  \item Repeat this process with the other Mimic module (Mimic-2nd), but choose red as the color
  \end{itemize}
\item Set up the correct parameters for each module and unpause the modules to begin signal output
\begin{itemize}
\item For Mimic-1st, set the \textbf{Offset} to 1 and untoggle the \textbf{Pause} button. At this point, Mimic-1st is outputting its signal to Mimic-2nd
\item For Mimic-2nd, set the \textbf{Gain} to 2, \textbf{Offset} to 1, and untoggle the \textbf{Pause} button. At this point, Mimic-2nd should \textit{transform} Mimic-1st's signal of 1 into a signal of 4, as shown in the oscilloscope
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
