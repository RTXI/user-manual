title = {Using realistic models to study synaptic integration in cerebellar Purkinje cells},
abstract = {This review presents an approach to modeling which we call "experiments in computo". The use of realistic models makes it possible to generate new predictions that can be confirmed experimentally. Several examples are given of how this approach has improved our understanding of synaptic integration by the Purkinje cell active dendrite. The computer model was constructed to replicate neuronal behavior which has no direct relevance to synaptic integration: it was tuned to reproduce the response of Purkinje cells to current injection in vitro, which consists of a high frequency, regular rhythm of somatic Na+ spikes, interrupted by spontaneous dendritic Ca2+ spikes. The in vivo firing behavior of Purkinje cells is quite different as it consists of highly irregular simple spike firing only, without spontaneous dendritic Ca2+ spikes. The computer model predicted-that the Purkinje cell needs to receive a continuous background inhibitory synaptic drive in addition to the excitation by parallel fibers to obtain this typical in vivo firing. This prediction was confirmed by blocking inhibition during in vivo intracellular recordings. More recently, we demonstrated that the net inhibitory drive to the Purkinje cell dendrite has to be larger than the excitatory synaptic drive. Inhibition hyperpolarizes the dendrite compared to the soma, making it act as a current sink during most of the spiking cycle. These predictions have been confirmed with the dynamic clamp method in the cerebellar slice preparation. Synchronous focal excitatory input by parallel fiber leads in the model to activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels which amplify the somatic response by a variable amount. The variability of this graded amplification is due both to position of the input, effectively canceling the cable attenuation, and to the effect of preceding background input. Differences between the model and experimental results in this aspect can be explained by the relative hyperpolarized state of Purkinje cells in the in vitro experimental preparation. These studies led to a new theory about the function of long-term depression in the cerebellum which can explain recent experimental results. In conclusion, our modeling approach generated predictions which contradicted prevalent ideas on how the cerebellum, or neurons in general, works and led to experiments which otherwise would not have been carried out.},

title = {Links from complex spikes to local plasticity and motor learning in the cerebellum of awake-behaving monkeys},
abstract = {The hypothesis of cerebellar learning proposes that complex spikes in Purkinje cells engage mechanisms of plasticity in the cerebellar cortex; in turn, changes in the cerebellum depress the simple-spike response of Purkinje cells to a given stimulus and cause the adaptive modification of a motor behavior. Although many elements of this hypothesis have been supported by prior experiments, the links between complex spikes, simple-spike plasticity and behavior have not yet been examined simultaneously during the learning process. We carried out a trial-by-trial analysis of Purkinje cell responses in awake-behaving monkeys and found evidence for a causal role for complex spikes in the induction of cerebellar plasticity during a simple motor learning task. We found that the presence of a complex spike on one learning trial was linked to a substantial depression of simple-spike responses on the subsequent trial, at a time when behavioral learning was expressed.},

title = {Dynamic-clamp analysis of the effects of convergence on spike timing. II. Few synaptic inputs},
abstract = {Sensory pathways in the nervous system possess mechanisms for decreasing spike-timing variability ("jitter"), probably to increase acuity. Most studies of jitter reduction have focused on convergence of many subthreshold inputs. However, many neurons receive only a few active inputs at any given time, and jitter reduction under these conditions is not well understood. We examined this issue using dynamic-clamp recordings in slices from mouse auditory brain stem. Significant jitter reduction was possible with as few as two inputs, provided the inputs had several features. First, jitter reduction was greatest and most reliable for supra-threshold inputs. Second, significant jitter reduction occurred when the distribution of input times had a rapid onset, i.e., for alpha- but not for Gaussian-distributed inputs. Third, jitter reduction was compromised unless late inputs were suppressed by the refractory period of the cell. These results contrast with the finding in the previous paper in which many subthreshold inputs contribute to jitter reduction, whether alpha- or Gaussian-distributed. In addition, convergence of many subthreshold inputs could fail to elicit any postsynaptic response when the input distribution outlasted the refractory period of the cell. These significant differences indicate that each means of reducing jitter has advantages and disadvantages and may be more effective for different neurons depending on the properties of their inputs.},

title = {Application of a NMDA Receptor Conductance in Rat Midbrain Dopaminergic Neurons Using the Dynamic Clamp Technique},
abstract = {Neuroscientists study the function of the brain by investigating how neurons in the brain communicate. Many investigators look at changes in the electrical activity of one or more neurons in response to an experimentally-controlled input. The electrical activity of neurons can be recorded in isolated brain slices using patch clamp techniques with glass micropipettes. Traditionally, experimenters can mimic neuronal input by direct injection of current through the pipette, electrical stimulation of the other cells or remaining axonal connections in the slice, or pharmacological manipulation by receptors located on the neuronal membrane of the recorded cell. Direct current injection has the advantages of passing a predetermined current waveform with high temporal precision at the site of the recording (usually the soma). However, it does not change the resistance of the neuronal membrane as no ion channels are physically opened. Current injection usually employs rectangular pulses and thus does not model the kinetics of ion channels. Finally, current injection cannot mimic the chemical changes in the cell that occurs with the opening of ion channels. Receptors can be physically activated by electrical or pharmacological stimulation. The experimenter has good temporal precision of receptor activation with electrical stimulation of the slice. However, there is limited spatial precision of receptor activation and the exact nature of what is activated upon stimulation is unknown. This latter problem can be partially alleviated by specific pharmacological agents. Unfortunately, the time course of activation of pharmacological agents is typically slow and the spatial precision of inputs onto the recorded cell is unknown. The dynamic clamp technique allows an experimenter to change the current passed directly into the cell based on real-time feedback of the membrane potential of the cell (Robinson and Kawai 1993, Sharp et al., 1993a,b; for review, see Prinz et al. 2004). This allows an experimenter to mimic the electrical changes that occur at the site of the recording in response to activation of a receptor. Real-time changes in applied current are determined by a mathematical equation implemented in hardware. We have recently used the dynamic clamp technique to investigate the generation of bursts of action potentials by phasic activation of NMDA receptors in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (Deister et al., 2009; Lobb et al., 2010). In this video, we demonstrate the procedures needed to apply a NMDA receptor conductance into a dopaminergic neuron.},

title = {Cell type-specific synaptic dynamics of synchronized bursting in the juvenile CA3 rat hippocampus},
abstract = {Spontaneous synchronous bursting of the CA3 hippocampus in vitro is a widely studied model of physiological and pathological network synchronization. The role of inhibitory conductances during network bursting is not understood in detail, despite the fact that several antiepileptic drugs target GABA(A) receptors. Here, we show that the first manifestation of a burst event is a cell type-specific flurry of GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory input to pyramidal cells, but not to stratum oriens horizontal interneurons. Moreover, GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic input is proportionally smaller in these interneurons compared with pyramidal cells. Computational models and dynamic-clamp studies using experimentally derived conductance waveforms indicate that both these factors modulate spike timing during synchronized activity. In particular, the different kinetics and the larger strength of GABAergic input to pyramidal cells defer action potential initiation and contribute to the observed delay of firing, so that the interneuronal activity leads the burst cycle. In contrast, excitatory inputs to both neuronal populations during a burst are kinetically similar, as required to maintain synchronicity. We also show that the natural pattern of activation of inhibitory and excitatory conductances during a synchronized burst cycle is different within the same neuronal population. In particular, GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents activate earlier and outlast the excitatory components driving the bursts. Thus, cell type-specific balance and timing of GABA(A) receptor-mediated input are critical to set the appropriate spike timing in pyramidal cells and interneurons and coordinate additional neurotransmitter release modulating burst strength and network frequency.},

title = {Asymmetric control of inspiratory and expiratory phases by excitability in the respiratory network of neonatal mice in vitro},
abstract = {Rhythmic motor behaviours consist of alternating movements, e.g. swing-stance in stepping, jaw opening and closing during chewing, and inspiration-expiration in breathing, which must be labile in frequency, and in some cases, in the duration of individual phases, to adjust to physiological demands. These movements are the expression of underlying neural circuits whose organization governs the properties of the motor behaviour. To determine if the ability to operate over a broad range of frequencies in respiration is expressed in the rhythm generator, we isolated the kernel of essential respiratory circuits using rhythmically active in vitro slices from neonatal mice. We show respiratory motor output in these slices at very low frequencies (0.008 Hz), well below the typical frequency in vitro (approximately 0.2 Hz) and in most intact normothermic mammals. Across this broad range of frequencies, inspiratory motor output bursts remained remarkably constant in pattern, i.e. duration, peak amplitude and area. The change in frequency was instead attributable to increased interburst interval, and was largely unaffected by removal of fast inhibitory transmission. Modulation of the frequency was primarily achieved by manipulating extracellular potassium, which significantly affects neuronal excitability. When excitability was lowered to slow down, or in some cases stop, spontaneous rhythm, brief stimulation of the respiratory network with a glutamatergic agonist could evoke (rhythmic) motor output. In slices with slow (<0.02 Hz) spontaneous rhythms, evoked motor output could follow a spontaneous burst at short (<or=1 s) or long (approximately 60 s) intervals. The intensity or timing of stimulation determined the latency to the first evoked burst, with no evidence for a refractory period greater than approximately 1 s, even with interburst intervals >60 s. We observed during inspiration a large magnitude (approximately 0.6 nA) outward current generated by Na(+)/K(+) ATPase that deactivated in 25-100 ms and thus could contribute to burst termination and the latency of evoked bursts but is unlikely to control the interburst interval. We propose that the respiratory network functions over a broad range of frequencies by engaging distinct mechanisms from those controlling inspiratory duration and pattern that specifically govern the interburst interval.},

title = {Low dose of dopamine may stimulate prolactin secretion by increasing fast potassium currents},
abstract = {Dopamine (DA) released from the hypothalamus tonically inhibits pituitary lactotrophs. DA (at micromolar concentration) opens potassium channels, hyperpolarizing the lactotrophs and thus preventing the calcium influx that triggers prolactin hormone release. Surprisingly, at concentrations similar to 1000 lower, DA can stimulate prolactin secretion. Here, we investigated whether an increase in a K+ current could mediate this stimulatory effect. We considered the fast K+ currents flowing through large-conductance BK channels and through A-type channels. We developed a minimal lactotroph model to investigate the effects of these two currents. Both I (BK) and I (A) could transform the electrical pattern of activity from spiking to bursting, but through distinct mechanisms. I (BK) always increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, while I-A could either increase or decrease it. Thus, the stimulatory effects of DA could be mediated by a fast K+ conductance which converts tonically spiking cells to bursters. In addition, the study illustrates that a heterogeneous distribution of fast K+ conductances could cause heterogeneous lactotroph firing patterns.},

abstract = {The Unscented Transform (UT) approximates the result of applying a specified nonlinear transformation to a given mean and covariance estimate. The UT works by constructing a set of points, referred to as sigma points, which has the same known statistics, e.g., first and second and possibly higher moments, as the given estimate. The given nonlinear transformation Is applied to the set, and the unscented estimate is obtained by computing the statistics of the transformed set of sigma points. For example, the mean and covariance of the transformed set approximates the nonlinear transformation of the original mean and covariance estimate. The computational efficiency of the UT therefore depends on the number of sigma points required to capture the known statistics of the original estimate. In this paper we examine methods for minimizing the number of sigma points for real-time control, estimation, and filtering applications. We demonstrate results in a 3D localization example.},

title = {Automatic fitting of spiking neuron models to electrophysiological recordings},
abstract = {Spiking models can accurately predict the spike trains produced by cortical neurons in response to somatically injected currents. Since the specific characteristics of the model depend on the neuron, a computational method is required to fit models to electrophysiological recordings. The fitting procedure can be very time consuming both in terms of computer simulations and in terms of code writing. We present algorithms to fit spiking models to electrophysiological data (time-varying input and spike trains) that can run in parallel on graphics processing units (GPUs). The model fitting library is interfaced with Brian, a neural network simulator in Python. If a GPU is present it uses just-in-time compilation to translate model equations into optimized code. Arbitrary models can then be defined at script level and run on the graphics card. This tool can be used to obtain empirically validated spiking models of neurons in various systems. We demonstrate its use on public data from the INCF Quantitative Single-Neuron Modeling 2009 competition by comparing the performance of a number of neuron spiking models.},

title = {Regularization mechanisms of spiking-bursting neurons},
abstract = {An essential question raised after the observation of highly variable bursting activity in individual neurons of Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) is how an assembly of such cells can cooperatively act to produce regular signals to motor systems. It is well known that some neurons in the lobster stomatogastric ganglion have a highly irregular spiking-bursting behavior when they are synaptically isolated from any connection in the CPG. Experimental recordings show that periodic stimuli on a single neuron can regulate its firing activity. Other evidence demonstrates that specific chemical and/or electrical synapses among neurons also induce the regularization of the rhythms. In this paper we present a modeling study in which a slow subcellular dynamics, the exchange of calcium between an intracellular store and the cytoplasm, is responsible for the origin and control of the irregular spiking-bursting activity. We show this in simulations of single cells under periodic driving and in minimal networks where the cooperative activity can induce regularization. While often neglected in the description of realistic neuron models, subcellular processes with slow dynamics may play an important role in information processing and short-term memory of spiking-bursting neurons.

title = {Firing-rate response of linear and nonlinear integrate-and-fire neurons to modulated current-based and conductance-based synaptic drive},
abstract = {Integrate-and-fire models are mainstays of the study of single-neuron response properties and emergent states of recurrent networks of spiking neurons. They also provide an analytical base for perturbative approaches that treat important biological details, such as synaptic filtering, synaptic conductance increase, and voltage-activated currents. Steady-state firing rates of both linear and nonlinear integrate-and-fire models, receiving fluctuating synaptic drive, can be calculated from the time-independent Fokker-Planck equation. The dynamic firing-rate response is less easy to extract, even at the first-order level of a weak modulation of the model parameters, but is an important determinant of neuronal response and network stability. For the linear integrate-and-fire model the response to modulations of current-based synaptic drive can be written in terms of hypergeometric functions. For the nonlinear exponential and quadratic models no such analytical forms for the response are available. Here it is demonstrated that a rather simple numerical method can be used to obtain the steady-state and dynamic response for both linear and nonlinear models to parameter modulation in the presence of current-based or conductance-based synaptic fluctuations. To complement the full numerical solution, generalized analytical forms for the high-frequency response are provided. A special case is also identified--time-constant modulation--for which the response to an arbitrarily strong modulation can be calculated exactly.},

title = {Effects of imperfect dynamic clamp: Computational and experimental results},
abstract = {In the dynamic clamp technique, a typically nonlinear feedback system delivers electrical current to an excitable cell that represents the actions of "virtual" ion channels (e.g., channels that are gated by local membrane potential or by electrical activity in neighboring biological or virtual neurons). Since the conception of this technique, there have been a number of different implementations of dynamic clamp systems, each with differing levels of flexibility and performance. Embedded hardware-based systems typically offer feedback that is very fast and precisely timed, but these systems are often expensive and sometimes inflexible. PC-based systems, on the other hand, allow the user to write software that defines an arbitrarily complex feedback system, but real-time performance in PC-based systems can be deteriorated by imperfect real-time performance. Here, we systematically evaluate the performance requirements for artificial dynamic clamp knock-in of transient sodium and delayed rectifier potassium conductances. Specifically, we examine the effects of controller time step duration, differential equation integration method, jitter (variability in time step), and latency (the time lag from reading inputs to updating outputs). Each of these control system flaws is artificially introduced in both simulated and real dynamic clamp experiments. We demonstrate that each of these errors affect dynamic clamp accuracy in a way that depends on the time constants and stiffness of the differential equations being solved. In simulations, time steps above 0.2ms lead to catastrophic alteration of spike shape, but the frequency-current relationship is much more robust. Latency (the part of the time step that occurs between measuring membrane potential and injecting re-calculated membrane current) is a crucial factor as well. Experimental data are substantially more sensitive to inaccuracies than simulated data.},

title = {Simple spike and complex spike activity of floccular Purkinje cells during the optokinetic reflex in mice lacking cerebellar long-term depression},
abstract = {Cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fibre-Purkinje cell (P-cell) synapses is thought to embody neuronal information storage for motor learning. Transgenic L7-protein kinase C inhibitor (PKCI) mice in which cerebellar LTD is selectively blocked do indeed exhibit impaired adaptation in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) while their default oculomotor performance is unaffected. Although supportive, these data do not definitively establish a causal link between memory storage required for motor learning and cerebellar LTD. As the L7-PKCI transgene is probably activated from the early stages of P-cell development, an alternative could be that P-cells develop abnormal signals in L7-PKCI mutants, disturbing mechanisms of motor learning that rely on proper P-cell outputs. To test this alternative hypothesis, we studied simple spike (SS) and complex spike (CS) activity of vertical axis P-cells in the flocculus of L7-PKCI mice and their wild-type littermates during sinusoidal optokinetic stimulation. Both SS and CS discharge dynamics appeared to be very similar in wild-type and transgenic P-cells at all stimulus frequencies (0.05-0.8 Hz). The CS activity of all vertical axis cells increased with contralateral stimulus rotation and lagged ipsiversive eye velocity by 165-180 degrees. The SS modulation was roughly reciprocal to the CS modulation and lagged ipsiversive eye velocity by approximately 15 degrees. The baseline SS and CS discharge characteristics were indistinguishable between the two genotypes. We conclude that the impaired VOR learning in L7-PKCI mutants does not reflect fundamental aberrations of the cerebellar circuitry. The data thus strengthen the evidence that cerebellar LTD is implicated in rapid VOR learning but not in the development of normal default response patterns.},

title = {Minimal alterations in T-type calcium channel gating markedly modify physiological firing dynamics},
abstract = {T-type calcium channel isoforms expressed in heterologous systems demonstrate marked differences in the biophysical properties of the resulting calcium currents. Such heterogeneity in gating behavior not only reflects structural differences but is also observed following the regulation of channel activity by a number of ligands. However, the physiological impact of these differences in gating parameters of the T channels has never been evaluated in situ where the unique interplay between T-type calcium and other intrinsic currents is conserved, and T channel activation can be triggered by synaptic stimulation. Here, using the dynamic clamp technique, artificial T conductances were re-incorporated in thalamic neurons devoid of endogenous T currents to dissect the physiological role of the T current gating diversity on neuronal excitability. We demonstrate that the specific kinetics of the T currents in thalamocortical and nucleus reticularis thalami neurons determine the characteristic firing patterns of these neurons. We show that subtle modifications in T channel gating that are at the limit of the resolution achieved in classical biophysical studies in heterologous expression systems have profound consequences on synaptically evoked firing dynamics in native neurons. Moreover, we demonstrate that the biophysical properties of the T current in the voltage region corresponding to the foot of the activation and inactivation curves drastically condition physiologically evoked burst firing with a high degree of synaptic input-specificity.},

title = {Two types of independent bursting mechanisms in inspiratory neurons: an integrative model},
abstract = {The network of coupled neurons in the pre-B{\"o}tzinger complex (pBC) of the medulla generates a bursting rhythm, which underlies the inspiratory phase of respiration. In some of these neurons, bursting persists even when synaptic coupling in the network is blocked and respiratory rhythmic discharge stops. Bursting in inspiratory neurons has been extensively studied, and two classes of bursting neurons have been identified, with bursting mechanism depends on either persistent sodium current or changes in intracellular Ca(2+), respectively. Motivated by experimental evidence from these intrinsically bursting neurons, we present a two-compartment mathematical model of an isolated pBC neuron with two independent bursting mechanisms. Bursting in the somatic compartment is modeled via inactivation of a persistent sodium current, whereas bursting in the dendritic compartment relies on Ca(2+) oscillations, which are determined by the neuromodulatory tone. The model explains a number of conflicting experimental results and is able to generate a robust bursting rhythm, over a large range of parameters, with a frequency adjusted by neuromodulators.},

title = {Shunting inhibition, a silent step in visual cortical computation},
abstract = {Brain computation, in the early visual system, is often considered as a hierarchical process in which features extracted in a given sensory relay are not present in previous stages of integration. In particular, orientation preference and its fine tuning selectivity are functional properties shared by most cortical cells and they are not observed at the preceding geniculate stage. A classical problem is identifying the mechanisms and circuitry underlying these computations. Several organizational principles have been proposed, giving different weights to the feedforward thalamocortical drive or to intracortical recurrent architectures. Within this context, an important issue is whether intracortical inhibition is fundamental for the genesis of stimulus selectivity, or rather normalizes spike response tuning with respect to other features such as stimulus strength or contrast, without influencing the selectivity bias and preference expressed in the excitatory input alone. We review here experimental observations concerning the presence or absence of inhibitory input evoked by non-preferred orientation/directions. Intracellular current clamp and voltage clamp recordings are analyzed in the light of new methods allowing us (1) to increase the visibility of inhibitory input, and (2) to continuously measure the visually evoked dynamics of input conductances. We conclude that there exists a diversity of synaptic input combinations generating the same profile of spike-based orientation selectivity, and that this diversity most likely reflects anatomical non-homogeneities in input sampling provided by the local context of the columnar and lateral intracortical network in which the considered cortical cell is embedded.},

title = {Electrophysiological characteristics of neurones in the guinea-pig deep cerebellar nuclei in vitro},
abstract = {The properties of neurones of the guinea-pig deep cerebellar nuclei in a slice preparation were investigated by intracellular recording. The recorded population of cells did not differ morphologically from nuclear cells in vivo as judged from neurones stained with Lucifer Yellow. Fifty-two out of sixty cells were spontaneously active with a regular firing pattern and a mean frequency of 26 +/- 14 (mean +/- S.D.) impulses/s. The action potentials lasted 0.41 +/- 0.07 ms (n = 60) with an amplitude of 58 +/- 8 mV. Input resistance was 44 +/- 10 M omega and the time constant of the membrane 13 +/- 3 ms. When stimulated with intracellularly injected depolarizing current pulses the cells responded with trains of action potentials. Near the threshold for the spike the stimulation produced firing of constant frequency and from more hyperpolarized levels an initial acceleration sometimes followed by a deceleration was seen. At levels less than 15 mV from the spike threshold there was a rebound train of spikes as a response to a hyperpolarizing current injection. At more hyperpolarized levels there was only a small depolarizing potential after the hyperpolarizing stimulation. Three types of subthreshold potentials were recorded. Spikelets rose from base line as 3-10 mV depolarizing wavelets with a duration between 5 and 10 ms. They served as trigger potentials for the action potential. Plateau potentials were slow depolarizing potentials often reaching the spike threshold and thus generating long trains of action potentials. After-hyperpolarizations followed each spike with a time course dependent on the previous activity of the cell. Plots of the firing frequency versus injected current were linear at the first and second interspike interval, after 50 ms of activity and at steady state. Plots of the voltage versus injected current were upward concave demonstrating anomalous rectification of the cell membrane. It is concluded that neurones in the deep cerebellar nuclei in vitro are spontaneously active because of the electroresponsive properties of their membranes. The physiological importance may be that the cerebellar output from these cells can be rapidly and efficiently modulated by synaptic potentials generated by Purkinje cells and mossy and climbing fibres.},

The neurons of the CPG are chaotic Hindmarsh-Rose models that cooperate dynamically to generate either chaotic or regular spatiotemporal patterns. These model neurons are implemented by computer simulations and electronic circuits. Out of a random pool of input configurations, a small subset of them maximizes the gain of information. Two important characteristics of this subset are emphasized: (1) the most regular output activities are chosen, and (2) none of the selected input configurations are networks with open topology. These two principles are observed in living CPGs as well as in model CPGs that are the most efficient in controlling mechanical tasks, and they are evidence that the information-theoretical analysis can be an invaluable tool in searching for general properties of CPGs.},

Chaos control techniques can increase the periodicity of such neuronal population bursting behaviour. Periodic pacing is also effective in entraining such systems, although in a qualitatively different fashion. Using a strategy of anticontrol such systems can be made less periodic.

title = {Behavioural improvements with thalamic stimulation after severe traumatic brain injury},
abstract = {Widespread loss of cerebral connectivity is assumed to underlie the failure of brain mechanisms that support communication and goal-directed behaviour following severe traumatic brain injury. Disorders of consciousness that persist for longer than 12 months after severe traumatic brain injury are generally considered to be immutable; no treatment has been shown to accelerate recovery or improve functional outcome in such cases. Recent studies have shown unexpected preservation of large-scale cerebral networks in patients in the minimally conscious state (MCS), a condition that is characterized by intermittent evidence of awareness of self or the environment. These findings indicate that there might be residual functional capacity in some patients that could be supported by therapeutic interventions. We hypothesize that further recovery in some patients in the MCS is limited by chronic underactivation of potentially recruitable large-scale networks. Here, in a 6-month double-blind alternating crossover study, we show that bilateral deep brain electrical stimulation (DBS) of the central thalamus modulates behavioural responsiveness in a patient who remained in MCS for 6 yr following traumatic brain injury before the intervention. The frequency of specific cognitively mediated behaviours (primary outcome measures) and functional limb control and oral feeding (secondary outcome measures) increased during periods in which DBS was on as compared with periods in which it was off. Logistic regression modelling shows a statistical linkage between the observed functional improvements and recent stimulation history. We interpret the DBS effects as compensating for a loss of arousal regulation that is normally controlled by the frontal lobe in the intact brain. These findings provide evidence that DBS can promote significant late functional recovery from severe traumatic brain injury. Our observations, years after the injury occurred, challenge the existing practice of early treatment discontinuation for patients with only inconsistent interactive behaviours and motivate further research to develop therapeutic interventions.},

title = {The impact of synaptic conductance on action potential waveform: evoking realistic action potentials with a simulated synaptic conductance},
abstract = {Most current clamp studies trigger action potentials (APs) by step current injection through the recording electrode and assume that the resulting APs are essentially identical to those triggered by orthodromic synaptic inputs. However this assumption is not always valid, particularly when the synaptic conductance is of large magnitude and of close proximity to the axon initial segment. We addressed this question of similarity using the Calyx of Held/MNTB synapse; we compared APs evoked by long duration step current injections, short step current injections and orthodromic synaptic stimuli. Neither injected current protocol evoked APs that matched the evoked orthodromic AP waveform, showing differences in AP height, half-width and after-hyperpolarization. We postulated that this 'error' could arise from changes in the instantaneous conductance during the combined synaptic and AP waveforms, since the driving forces for the respective ionic currents are integrating and continually evolving over this time-course. We demonstrate that a simple Ohm's law manipulation of the EPSC waveform, which accounts for the evolving driving force on the synaptic conductance during the AP, produces waveforms that closely mimic those generated by physiological synaptic stimulation. This stimulation paradigm allows supra-threshold physiological stimulation (single stimuli or trains) without the variability caused by quantal fluctuation in transmitter release, and can be implemented without a specialised dynamic clamp system. Combined with pharmacological tools this method provides a reliable means to assess the physiological roles of postsynaptic ion channels without confounding affects from the presynaptic input.},

In thalamocortical (TC) and nucleus reticularis thalami (NRT) neurones, and possibly in neocortical cells, an I-Twindow-mediated bistability is the key cellular mechanism underlying the expression of the slow (<1 Hz) sleep oscillation, one of the fundamental EEG rhythms of non-REM sleep. As the I-Twindow-mediated bistability may also represent one of the cellular mechanisms underlying the expression of high frequency burst firing in awake conditions, I-Twindow is of critical importance in neuronal population dynamics associated with different behavioural states.},

title = {Downregulation of dendritic I(h) in CA1 pyramidal neurons after LTP},
abstract = {Hyperpolarization-activated (h)-channels occupy a central position in dendritic function. Although it has been demonstrated that these channels are upregulated after large depolarizations to reduce dendritic excitation, it is not clear whether they also support other forms of long-term plasticity. We show here that nearly maximal long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta-burst pairing produced upregulation in h-channel activity in CA1 pyramidal neurons. In contrast, moderate LTP induced by spike-timing-dependent plasticity or high-frequency stimulation (HFS) downregulated the h-current (I(h)) in the dendrites. After HFS-induced LTP, the h-conductance (G(h)) was reduced without changing its activation. Pharmacological blockade of I(h) had no effect on LTP induction, but occluded EPSP-to-spike potentiation, an input-specific facilitation of dendritic integration. Dynamic-clamp reduction of G(h) locally in the dendrite mimicked the effects of HFS and enhanced synaptic integration in an input-selective way. We conclude that dendritic I(h) is locally downregulated after induction of nonmaximal LTP, thus facilitating integration of the potentiated input.},

title = {Sodium and calcium current-mediated pacemaker neurons and respiratory rhythm generation},
abstract = {The breathing motor pattern in mammals originates in brainstem networks. Whether pacemaker neurons play an obligatory role remains a key unanswered question. We performed whole-cell recordings in the preBotzinger Complex in slice preparations from neonatal rodents and tested for pacemaker activity. We observed persistent Na+ current (I(NaP))-mediated bursting in approximately 5% of inspiratory neurons in postnatal day 0 (P0)-P5 and in P8-P10 slices. I(NaP)-mediated bursting was voltage dependent and blocked by 20 mum riluzole (RIL). We found Ca2+ current (I(Ca))-dependent bursting in 7.5% of inspiratory neurons in P8-P10 slices, but in P0-P5 slices these cells were exceedingly rare (0.6%). This bursting was voltage independent and blocked by 100 microm Cd2+ or flufenamic acid (FFA) (10-200 microm), which suggests that a Ca2+-activated inward cationic current (I(CAN)) underlies burst generation. These data substantiate our observation that P0-P5 slices exposed to RIL contain few (if any) pacemaker neurons, yet maintain respiratory rhythm. We also show that 20 nm TTX or coapplication of 20 microm RIL + FFA (100-200 microm) stops the respiratory rhythm, but that adding 2 mum substance P restarts it. We conclude that I(NaP) and I(CAN) enhance neuronal excitability and promote rhythmogenesis, even if their magnitude is insufficient to support bursting-pacemaker activity in individual neurons. When I(NaP) and I(CAN) are removed pharmacologically, the rhythm can be maintained by boosting neural excitability, which is inconsistent with a pacemaker-essential mechanism of respiratory rhythmogenesis by the preBotzinger complex.},

CN neurons in slices show intrinsic pacemaking activity, which is easily modulated by synaptic inputs. Our work using dynamic clamping and computer modeling shows that synchronicity between PC inputs is an important factor in determining spike rate and spike timing of CN neurons and that brief pauses in PC inputs provide a potent stimulus to trigger CN spikes. Excitatory input can equally control spike rate, but, due to a large slow, NMDA component also amplifies responses to inhibitory inputs. Intrinsic properties of CN neurons are well suited to provide prolonged responses to strong input transients and could be involved in motor pattern generation. One such specific mechanism is given by fast and slow rebound bursting. Nevertheless, we are just beginning to unravel synaptic integration in the CN, and the outcome of the work to date is best characterized by the generation of new specific questions that lend themselves to a combined experimental and computer modeling approach in future studies.},

abstract = {Dopamine (DA) released from the hypothalamus tonically inhibits pituitary lactotrophs. DA (at micromolar concentration) opens potassium channels, hyperpolarizing the lactotrophs and thus preventing the calcium influx that triggers prolactin hormone release. Surprisingly, at concentrations approximately 1000 lower, DA can stimulate prolactin secretion. Here, we investigated whether an increase in a K+ current could mediate this stimulatory effect. We considered the fast K+ currents flowing through large-conductance BK channels and through A-type channels. We developed a minimal lactotroph model to investigate the effects of these two currents. Both IBK and IA could transform the electrical pattern of activity from spiking to bursting, but through distinct mechanisms. IBK always increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, while IA could either increase or decrease it. Thus, the stimulatory effects of DA could be mediated by a fast K+ conductance which converts tonically spiking cells to bursters. In addition, the study illustrates that},

title = {Hybrid systems analysis of the control of burst duration by low-voltage-activated calcium current in leech heart interneurons},
abstract = {The leech heartbeat CPG is paced by the alternating bursting of pairs of mutually inhibitory heart interneurons that form elemental half-center oscillators. We explore the control of burst duration in heart interneurons using a hybrid system, where a living, pharmacologically isolated, heart interneuron is connected with artificial synapses to a model heart interneuron running in real-time, by focusing on a low-voltage-activated (LVA) calcium current I-CaS. The transition from silence to bursting in this half-center oscillator occurs when the spike frequency of the bursting interneuron declines to a critical level, f(Final), at which the inhibited interneuron escapes owing to a build-up of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current, I-h. We varied I-CaS inactivation time constant either in the living heart interneuron or in the model heart interneuron. In both cases, varying I-CaS inactivation time constant did not affect f(Final) of either interneuron, but in the varied interneuron, the time constant of decline of spike frequency during bursts to f(Final) and thus the burst duration varied directly and nearly linearly with I-CaS inactivation time constant. Bursts of the opposite, nonvaried interneuron did not change. We show also that control of burst duration by I-CaS inactivation does not require synaptic interaction by reconstituting autonomous bursting in synaptically isolated living interneurons with injected I-CaS. Therefore inactivation of LVA calcium current is critically important for setting burst duration and thus period in a heart interneuron half-center oscillator and is potentially a general intrinsic mechanism for regulating burst duration in neurons.},

title = {Dynamic clamp study of Ih modulation of burst firing and delta oscillations in thalamocortical neurons in vitro},
abstract = {The dynamic clamp technique was used in thalamocortical neurons of the rat and cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in vitro to investigate the effects of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current, Ih, and of its neuromodulation on burst firing and delta oscillations. Specific block of endogenous Ih using 4-(N-ethyl-N-phenylamino)-1,2-dimethyl-6-(methylamino)pyridinium chloride (ZD7288) (300 microM) abolished the depolarizing "sag" response to negative current steps, markedly increased the latency and shortened the duration of the low-threshold Ca2+ potentials, and decreased the number of action potentials in the burst evoked by the low-threshold Ca2+ potential. Subsequent introduction of artificial Ih using the dynamic clamp re-instated the "sag" and all the original properties of the low-threshold Ca2+ potential. In the absence of ZD7288, introduction of artificial outward Ih with the intention of abolishing endogenous Ih removed the depolarizing "sag" and produced similar effects on the low-threshold Ca2+ potentials as those observed during the pharmacological block of Ih. Application of ZD7288 to thalamocortical neurons displaying delta oscillations led to a reduction in the voltage range of their existence or to a complete cessation of this behaviour. A subsequent introduction of artificial Ih re-enabled the generation of delta oscillations. In the presence of ZD7288, physiologically relevant positive shifts in the voltage-dependence of artificial Ih increased the amplitude and duration of the low-threshold Ca2+ potential and increased the likelihood of delta oscillations while negative shifts had opposite effects. These results highlight the important difference between the dependence of burst firing and oscillations on membrane potential and their dependence on the properties of Ih, and demonstrate that the modulation by Ih of low-threshold Ca2+ potentials and burst firing in thalamocortical neurons, as well as the ability of these neurons to generate delta oscillations, is more elaborate than previously described.},

title = {Maturation of EPSCs and intrinsic membrane properties enhances precision at a cerebellar synapse},
abstract = {The timing of action potentials is an important determinant of information coding in the brain. The shape of the EPSP has a key influence on the temporal precision of spike generation. Here we use dynamic clamp recording and passive neuronal models to study how developmental changes in synaptic conductance waveform and intrinsic membrane properties combine to affect the EPSP and action potential generation in cerebellar granule cells. We recorded EPSCs at newly formed and mature mossy fiber-granule cell synapses. Both quantal and evoked currents showed a marked speeding of the AMPA receptor-mediated component. We also found evidence for age- and activity-dependent changes in the involvement of NMDA receptors. Although AMPA and NMDA receptors contributed to quantal EPSCs at immature synapses, multiquantal release was required to activate NMDA receptors at mature synapses, suggesting a developmental redistribution of NMDA receptors. These changes in the synaptic conductance waveform result in a faster rising EPSP and reduced spike latency in mature granule cells. Mature granule cells also have a significantly decreased input resistance, contributing to a faster decaying EPSP and a reduced spike jitter. We suggest that these concurrent developmental changes, which increase the temporal precision of EPSP-spike coupling, will increase the fidelity with which sensory information is processed within the input layer of the cerebellar cortex.},

abstract = {Previous computational modeling studies suggested a set of rules underlying the modulation of principal cell firing rates by heterogeneity in the synaptic parameters (peak amplitude and decay kinetics) of populations of GABAergic inputs. Here we performed dynamic clamp experiments in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells to test these ideas in biological neurons. In agreement with the simulation studies, the effects of increasing the event-to-event variance in a population of perisomatically injected inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) peak conductances caused either an increase, decrease, or no change in the firing rates of CA1 pyramidal cells depending on the mean around which the scatter was introduced, the degree of the scatter, the depolarization that the pyramidal cell received, and the IPSC reversal potential. In contrast to CA1 pyramidal cells, both model and biological CA3 pyramidal cells responded with bursts of action potentials to sudden, step-wise alterations in input heterogeneity. In addition, injections of 40-Hz IPSC conductances together with -modulated depolarizing current inputs to CA1 pyramidal cells demonstrated that the principles underlying the modulation of pyramidal cell excitability by heterogeneous IPSC populations also apply during membrane potential oscillations. Taken together, these experimental results and the computational modeling data show the existence of simple rules governing the interactions of heterogeneous interneuronal inputs and principal cells.},

title = {Bistable network behavior of layer I interneurons in auditory cortex},
abstract = {GABAergic interneurons in many areas of the neocortex are mutually connected via chemical and electrical synapses. Previous computational studies have explored how these coupling parameters influence the firing patterns of interneuronal networks. These models have predicted that the stable states of such interneuronal networks will be either synchrony (near zero phase lag) or antisynchrony (phase lag near one-half of the interspike interval), depending on network connectivity and firing rates. In certain parameter regimens, the network can be bistable, settling into either stable state depending on the initial conditions. Here, we investigated how connectivity parameters influence spike patterns in paired recordings from layer I interneurons in brain slices from juvenile mice. Observed properties of chemical and electrical synapses were used to simulate connections between uncoupled cells via dynamic clamp. In uncoupled pairs, action potentials induced by constant depolarizing currents had randomly distributed phase differences between the two cells. When coupled with simulated chemical (inhibitory) synapses, however, these pairs exhibited a bimodal firing pattern, tending to fire either in synchrony or in antisynchrony. Combining electrical with chemical synapses, prolonging tau(Decay) of inhibitory connections, or increasing the firing rate of the network all resulted in enhanced stability of the synchronous state. Thus, electrical and inhibitory synaptic coupling constrain the relative timing of spikes in a two-cell network to, at most, two stable states, the stability and precision of which depend on the exact parameters of coupling.},

title = {Role of the transient outward current (Ito) in shaping canine ventricular action potential--a dynamic clamp study},
abstract = {Transmural electrical dispersion determines the repolarization sequence across the ventricular wall, and plays an important role in the development of arrhythmias under pathological conditions. While it is clear that the transmural gradient of the transient outward current (I(to)) underlies the dramatic difference in phase 1 repolarization across the ventricle, its contribution to the transmural action potential duration (APD) dispersion is not clear. We investigated this problem using the dynamic clamp technique in canine ventricular myocytes. The dynamic clamp allows quantitative 'insertion' of simulated conductances in real, biological cells, bridging pure computer modelling and experimental electrophysiology. 'Insertion' of an epicardial level of I(to) in endocardial cells produced a prominent phase 1 repolarization and a 'spike-and-dome' action potential morphology, but did not significantly affect the APD. Increasingly larger I(to) densities prolonged, and then dramatically shortened the endocardial APD. We also used the dynamic clamp to subtract, or 'block' the native I(to) in epicardial cells. Such 'blockade' eliminated the epicardial action potential notch, but had no significant effect on the APD. We conclude that I(to), while being a key regulator of phase 1 repolarization, does not significantly affect the APD of canine ventricular myocytes, and that the I(to) gradient is not a significant contributor to the transmural APD dispersion in the canine ventricle. By allowing computer simulation on a biological background, the dynamic clamp is a new and effective tool to study the ionic basis of the electrical properties of cardiac cells.},

title = {Kinetics of slow inactivation of persistent sodium current in layer V neurons of mouse neocortical slices},
abstract = {1. In whole cell recordings from layer V neurons in slices of mouse somatosensory neocortex, tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive persistent Na+ current (I-NaP) was studied by blocking K+ currents with intracellular Cs+ and Ca2+ currents with extracellular Cd2+. During slow voltage ramps, I-NaP began to activate at around -60 mV, and attained a peak at around -25 mV. The peak amplitude of I-NaP varied widely from cell to cell (range 60-3, 160 pA; median 308 pA, n=77). At potentials more positive than -35 mV, I-NaP in all cells was superimposed on a large, TTX-resistant outward current. 2. In hybrid clamp experiments, I-NaP was significantly reduced by a preceding high-frequency train of spikes. 3. I-NaP underwent pronounced slow inactivation, which was revealed by systematically varying the ramp speed between 233 and 2.33 mV/s, or varying the duration of a depolarizing prepulse between 0.1 and 10 s. 4. Onset of slow inactivation at +20 mV was monoexponential with tau=2.06 s (n=17 cells). Recovery from slow inactivation was voltage dependent. It followed a monoexponential time course with tau=2.31 s (n=6) at -70 mV and tau=1.10 s (n=4) at -90 mV. These values are not significantly different than values previously reported for slow inactivation of fast-inactivating I-Na 5. Slow inactivation of neocortical I-NaP will influence all neuronal functions in which this current plays a role, including spike threshold determination, synaptic integration, and active propagation in dendrites. The kinetics of slow inactivation suggest that it may be a factor not only during extremely intense spiking, but also during periods of ''spontaneous'' activity.},

abstract = {Do cortical neurons operate as integrators or as coincidence detectors? Despite the importance of this question, no definite answer has been given yet, because each of these two views can find its own experimental support. Here we investigated this question using models of morphologically-reconstructed neocortical pyramidal neurons under in vivo like conditions. In agreement with experiments we find that the cell is capable of operating in a continuum between coincidence detection and temporal integration, depending on the characteristics of the synaptic inputs. Moreover, the presence of synaptic background activity at a level comparable to intracellular measurements in vivo can modulate the operating mode of the cell, and act as a switch between temporal integration and coincidence detection. These results suggest that background activity can be viewed as an important determinant of the integrative mode of pyramidal neurons. Thus, background activity not only sharpens cortical responses but it can also be used to tune an entire network between integration and coincidence detection modes.},

abstract = {Synaptic noise due to intense network activity can have a significant impact on the electrophysiological properties of individual neurons. This is the case for the cerebral cortex, where ongoing activity leads to strong barrages of synaptic inputs, which act as the main source of synaptic noise affecting on neuronal dynamics. Here, we characterize the subthreshold behavior of neuronal models in which synaptic noise is represented by either additive or multiplicative noise, described by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. We derive and solve the Fokker-Planck equation for this system, which describes the time evolution of the probability density function for the membrane potential. We obtain an analytic expression for the membrane potential distribution at steady state and compare this expression with the subthreshold activity obtained in Hodgkin-Huxley-type models with stochastic synaptic inputs. The differences between multiplicative and additive noise models suggest that multiplicative noise is adequate to describe the high-conductance states similar to in vivo conditions. Because the steady-state membrane potential distribution is easily obtained experimentally, this approach provides a possible method to estimate the mean and variance of synaptic conductances in real neurons.},

abstract = {Recordings of the membrane potential from a bursting neuron were used to reconstruct the phase curve for that neuron for a limited set of perturbations. These perturbations were inhibitory synaptic conductance pulses able to shift the membrane potential below the most hyperpolarized level attained in the free running mode. The extraction of the phase resetting curve from such a one-dimensional time series requires reconstruction of the periodic activity in the form of a limit cycle attractor. Resetting was found to have two components. In the first component, if the pulse was applied during a burst, the burst was truncated, and the time until the next burst was shortened in a manner predicted by movement normal to the limit cycle. By movement normal to the limit cycle, we mean a switch between two well-defined solution branches of a relaxation-like oscillator in a hysteretic manner enabled by the existence of a singular dominant slow process (variable). In the second component, the onset of the burst was delayed until the end of the hyperpolarizing pulse. Thus, for the pulse amplitudes we studied, resetting was independent of amplitude but increased linearly with pulse duration. The predicted and the experimental phase resetting curves for a pyloric dilator neuron show satisfactory agreement. The method was applied to only one pulse per cycle, but our results suggest it could easily be generalized to accommodate multiple inputs.},

title = {Activity induced elevations of intracellular calcium concentration in neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei},
abstract = {1. Depolarization-induced changes in the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) were examined in slice-cultured neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei by combined intracellular and multisite fura-2 recording techniques. 2. Firing of tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive action potentials induced by depolarizing current pulses caused large elevations in somatic as well as proximal dendritic [Ca2+]i. In the dendrites, rise and decay times of [Ca2+]i were faster than in the soma. [Ca2+]i changes associated with depolarizations to < or = -40 mV in the presence of TTX were small compared with changes induced by Na+ spike firing, suggesting that Ca2+ influx through high voltage-activated Ca2+ channels is a major cause for Na+ spike-associated [Ca2+]i increases. 3. During sustained Na+ spike firing at a constant frequency (> 20 Hz), [Ca2+]i approached a constant level, after approximately 1 s in the dendrites and 2 s in the soma, respectively. The amplitude of the attained level was positively correlated with the firing frequency. We suggest that during tonic activity [Ca2+]i reaches a steady state determined by Ca2+ influx and extrusion. 4. TTX-resistant plateau potentials caused substantially greater [Ca2+]i increases in the dendrites than in the soma. In the dendrites, plateau-associated Ca2+ transients were comparable in amplitude to Ca2+ transients triggered by short (50 ms) Na+ spike trains, in the soma, they were considerably smaller. 5. Low-threshold spikes (LTSs) in association with a burst of Na+ spikes induced a sharp increase in [Ca2+]i both in the soma and in dendrites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

title = {Minimal Models of Bursting Neurons: How Multiple Currents, Conductances, and Timescales Affect Bifurcation Diagrams},
abstract = {After reviewing the Hodgkin--Huxley ionic current formulation, we introduce a three-variable generic model of a single-compartment neuron comprising a two-dimensional fast subsystem and a very slow recovery variable. We study the effects of fast and slow currents on the existence and stability of equilibria and periodic orbits for the fast subsystem, presenting a classification of currents and developing graphical tools that aid in the analysis and construction of models with specified properties. We draw on these to propose a minimal model of a bursting neuron, identifying biophysical parameters that can shape and regulate key characteristics of the membrane voltage pattern: bursting frequency, duty cycle, spike rate, and the number of action potentials per burst. We present additional examples from the literature for comparison and illustration, and in a companion paper.},

abstract = {Dynamic data-driven brain-machine interfaces (DDDBMI) have great potential to advance the understanding of neural systems and improve the design of brain-inspired rehabilitative systems. This paper presents a novel cyberinfrastructure that couples in vivo neurophysiology experimentation with massive computational resources to provide seamless and efficient support of DDDBMI research. Closed-loop experiments can be conducted with in vivo data acquisition, reliable network transfer, parallel model computation, and real-time robot control. Behavioral experiments with live animals are supported with real-time guarantees. Offline studies can be performed with various configurations for extensive analysis and training. A Web-based portal is also provided to allow users to conveniently interact with the cyberinfrastructure, conducting both experimentation and analysis. New motor control models are developed based on this approach, which include recursive least square based (RLS) and reinforcement learning based (RLBMI) algorithms. The results from an online RLBMI experiment shows that the cyberinfrastructure can successfully support DDDBMI experiments and meet the desired real-time requirements.},

title = {Subunit dependence of Na channel slow inactivation and open channel block in cerebellar neurons},
abstract = {Purkinje and cerebellar nuclear neurons both have Na currents with resurgent kinetics. Previous observations, however, suggest that their Na channels differ in their susceptibility to entering long-lived inactivated states. To compare fast inactivation, slow inactivation, and open-channel block, we recorded voltage-clamped, tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na currents in Purkinje and nuclear neurons acutely isolated from mouse cerebellum. In nuclear neurons, recovery from all inactivated states was slower, and open-channel unblock was less voltage-dependent than in Purkinje cells. To test whether specific subunits contributed to this differential stability of inactivation, experiments were repeated in Na(V)1.6-null (med) mice. In med Purkinje cells, recovery times were prolonged and the voltage dependence of open-channel block was reduced relative to control cells, suggesting that availability of Na(V)1.6 is quickly restored at negative potentials. In med nuclear cells, however, currents were unchanged, suggesting that NaV1.6 contributes little to wild-type nuclear cells. Extracellular Na+ prevented slow inactivation more effectively in Purkinje than in nuclear neurons, consistent with a resilience of NaV1.6 to slow inactivation. The tendency of nuclear Na channels to inactivate produced a low availability during trains of spike-like depolarization. Hyperpolarizations that approximated synaptic inhibition effectively recovered channels, suggesting that increases in Na channel availability promote rebound. ring after inhibition.},

title = {State changes rapidly modulate cortical neuronal responsiveness},
abstract = {The responsiveness of cortical neurons is strongly and rapidly influenced by changes in the level of local network activity. In rodent somatosensory cortex, increases in network activity increase neuronal responsiveness to the intracellular injection of brief conductance stimuli but paradoxically decrease responsiveness to brief whisker deflections. However, whisker stimulation frequently evokes long-lasting changes in the level of local circuit activity. The ability of stimuli to successfully evoke prolonged increases in circuit activity is associated with both an increase in the amount of conductance evoked by a whisker stimulus and an increase in action potential responsiveness to whisker stimulation. In addition, brief whisker stimuli presented during periods of high network activity evoke postsynaptic potentials containing a greater proportion of inhibition, consistent with an increased efficiency in the activation of inhibitory mechanisms during the Up state. In contrast, during prolonged and variable whisker stimulation, increased network activity is associated with an increase in overall responsiveness, dynamic range, output gain, and correlation between action potential response and speed of whisker movement. We conclude that stimulus-evoked or spontaneous alterations in cortical state can influence neuronal responsiveness in a complex manner, resulting in large changes in which, and how, sensory stimuli are represented.},

abstract = {A method that combines the means of unscented Kalman filter (UKF) with the technique of synchronization-based parameter estimation is introduced for estimating unknown parameters of neuron when only a heavily noise-corrupted time series of active potential is given. Compared with other synchronization-based methods, this approach uses the state variables estimated by UKF instead of the measured data to drive the auxiliary system. The synchronization-based approach supplies a systematic and analytical procedure for estimating parameters from time series; however, it is only robust against weak noise of measurement, so the UKF is employed to estimate state variables which are used by the synchronization-based method to estimate all unknown parameters of neuron model. It is found out that the estimation accuracy of this combined method is much higher than only using UKF or synchronization-based method when the data of measurement were heavily noise corrupted.},

title = {Neocortical network activity in vivo is generated through a dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition},
abstract = {The recurrent excitatory and inhibitory connections between and within layers of the cerebral cortex are fundamental to the operation of local cortical circuits. Models of cortical function often assume that recurrent excitation and inhibition are balanced, and we recently demonstrated that spontaneous network activity in vitro contains a precise balance of excitation and inhibition; however, the existence of a balance between excitation and inhibition in the intact and spontaneously active cerebral cortex has not been directly tested. We examined this hypothesis in the prefrontal cortex in vivo, during the slow (<1 Hz) oscillation in ketamine-xylazine-anesthetized ferrets. We measured persistent network activity (Up states) with extracellular multiple unit and local field potential recording, while simultaneously recording synaptic currents in nearby cells. We determined the reversal potential and conductance change over time during Up states and found that the body of Up state activity exhibited a steady reversal potential (-37 mV on average) for hundreds of milliseconds, even during substantial (21 nS on average) changes in membrane conductance. Furthermore, we found that both the initial and final segments of the Up state were characterized by significantly more depolarized reversal potentials and concomitant increases in excitatory conductance, compared with the stable middle portions of Up states. This ongoing temporal evolution between excitation and inhibition, which exhibits remarkable proportionality within and across neurons in active local networks, may allow for rapid transitions between relatively stable network states, permitting the modulation of neuronal responsiveness in a behaviorally relevant manner.},

title = {Evaluating automated parameter constraining procedures of neuron models by experimental and surrogate data},
abstract = {Neuron models, in particular conductance-based compartmental models, often have numerous parameters that cannot be directly determined experimentally and must be constrained by an optimization procedure. A common practice in evaluating the utility of such procedures is using a previously developed model to generate surrogate data (e.g., traces of spikes following step current pulses) and then challenging the algorithm to recover the original parameters (e.g., the value of maximal ion channel conductances) that were used to generate the data. In this fashion, the success or failure of the model fitting procedure to find the original parameters can be easily determined. Here we show that some model fitting procedures that provide an excellent fit in the case of such model-to-model comparisons provide ill-balanced results when applied to experimental data. The main reason is that surrogate and experimental data test different aspects of the algorithm's function. When considering model-generated surrogate data, the algorithm is required to locate a perfect solution that is known to exist. In contrast, when considering experimental target data, there is no guarantee that a perfect solution is part of the search space. In this case, the optimization procedure must rank all imperfect approximations and ultimately select the best approximation. This aspect is not tested at all when considering surrogate data since at least one perfect solution is known to exist (the original parameters) making all approximations unnecessary. Furthermore, we demonstrate that distance functions based on extracting a set of features from the target data (such as time-to-first-spike, spike width, spike frequency, etc.)--rather than using the original data (e.g., the whole spike trace) as the target for fitting-are capable of finding imperfect solutions that are good approximations of the experimental data.},

title = {Phase-response curves and synchronized neural networks},
abstract = {We review the principal assumptions underlying the application of phase-response curves (PRCs) to synchronization in neuronal networks. The PRC measures how much a given synaptic input perturbs spike timing in a neural oscillator. Among other applications, PRCs make explicit predictions about whether a given network of interconnected neurons will synchronize, as is often observed in cortical structures. Regarding the assumptions of the PRC theory, we conclude: (i) The assumption of noise-tolerant cellular oscillations at or near the network frequency holds in some but not all cases. (ii) Reduced models for PRC-based analysis can be formally related to more realistic models. (iii) Spike-rate adaptation limits PRC-based analysis but does not invalidate it. (iv) The dependence of PRCs on synaptic location emphasizes the importance of improving methods of synaptic stimulation. (v) New methods can distinguish between oscillations that derive from mutual connections and those arising from common drive. (vi) It is helpful to assume linear summation of effects of synaptic inputs; experiments with trains of inputs call this assumption into question. (vii) Relatively subtle changes in network structure can invalidate PRC-based predictions. (viii) Heterogeneity in the preferred frequencies of component neurons does not invalidate PRC analysis, but can annihilate synchronous activity.},

title = {Responses to tactile stimulation in deep cerebellar nucleus neurons result from recurrent activation in multiple pathways},
abstract = {In a previous study, we found that neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) respond to 5-ms brief facial tactile stimulation in rats anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine with multiphasic response patterns lasting over 200 ms. It remained unclear, however, to what extent these responses were shaped not only by ascending sensory input from the trigeminal nuclei but also by interactions with other major cerebellar afferent systems, in particular the inferior olive (IO) and cerebral cortex. In the present study, we recorded from the IO, cerebral cortex, cerebellar granule cell layer (GCL), and DCN during the presentation of 5-ms facial tactile stimuli to elucidate potential mechanisms of how extended DCN response patterns are generated. We found that tactile stimulation resulted in robust multiphasic local field potentials responses in the IO as well as in the activation of a wide region of the somatosensory cortex (SI) and the primary motor cortex (MI). DCN neurons responded to electrical stimulation of any of these structures (IO, SI, and MI) with complex temporal patterns strikingly similar to air-puff lip stimulation responses. Simultaneous recordings from multiple structures revealed that long-lasting activation patterns elicited in DCN neurons were based on recurrent network activation in particular between the IO and the DCN with a potential contribution of DCN rebound properties. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that sensory stimulation triggers a feedback network activation of cerebellum, IO, and cerebral cortex to generate temporal patterns of activity that may control the timing of behavior.},

title = {Membrane resonance in bursting pacemaker neurons of an oscillatory network is correlated with network frequency},
abstract = {Network oscillations typically span a limited range of frequency. In pacemaker-driven networks, including many central pattern generators (CPGs), this frequency range is determined by the properties of bursting pacemaker neurons and their synaptic connections; thus, factors that affect the burst frequency of pacemaker neurons should play a role in determining the network frequency. We examine the role of membrane resonance of pacemaker neurons on the network frequency in the crab pyloric CPG. The pyloric oscillations (frequency of approximately 1 Hz) are generated by a group of pacemaker neurons: the anterior burster (AB) and the pyloric dilator (PD). We examine the impedance profiles of the AB and PD neurons in response to sinusoidal current injections with varying frequency and find that both neuron types exhibit membrane resonance, i.e., demonstrate maximal impedance at a given preferred frequency. The membrane resonance frequencies of the AB and PD neurons fall within the range of the pyloric network oscillation frequency. Experiments with pharmacological blockers and computational modeling show that both calcium currents I(Ca) and the hyperpolarization-activated inward current I(h) are important in producing the membrane resonance in these neurons. We then demonstrate that both the membrane resonance frequency of the PD neuron and its suprathreshold bursting frequency can be shifted in the same direction by either direct current injection or by using the dynamic-clamp technique to inject artificial conductances for I(h) or I(Ca). Together, these results suggest that membrane resonance of pacemaker neurons can be strongly correlated with the CPG oscillation frequency.},

A minimal neural network proposed to reproduce these transformations includes 1) a ringlike mutually inhibitory network composed of the postinspiratory, augmenting expiratory, and early-inspiratory neurons and 2) an excitatory preinspiratory neuron, with persistent sodium current (I(NaP))-dependent intrinsic bursting properties, that dynamically participates in the expiratory-inspiratory phase transition and inspiratory phase generation. We used activity-based single-neuron models and applied numerical simulations, bifurcation methods, and fast-slow decomposition to describe the behavior of this network in the functional states corresponding to the three-, two-, and one-phase oscillatory regimes, as well as to analyze the transitions between states and between respiratory phases within each state. We demonstrate that, although I(NaP) is not necessary for the generation of three- and two-phase oscillations, it contributes to control of the oscillation period in each state. We also show that the transitions between states can be produced by progressive changes of drives to particular neurons and proceed through intermediate regimes, featuring high-amplitude late-expiratory and biphasic-expiratory activities or ectopic burst generation. Our results provide important insights for understanding the state-dependent mechanisms for respiratory rhythm generation and control.},

title = {MRCI: a flexible real-time dynamic clamp system for electrophysiology experiments},
abstract = {We present a real-time simulation system that enables modeled dynamical systems to interact with physical experimental systems, and is specifically aimed towards execution of the dynamic clamp protocol. Model reference current injection (MRCI) operates under Real-Time Linux (RT-Linux or RTL) and provides a simple equation-oriented language for describing dynamical system models. Features include scripting of commands to implement repeatable protocols, the ability to output pre-computed waveforms through any variable or parameter of the model, the means to conduct time measurements and assess the computational performance of the real-time system, and an installation program that installs the software and accompanying device drivers with minimal input from the user. Tested models operate as fast as 30 kHz, with actual maximum rates dependent on model complexity. We present sample models that exhibit the main features of the modeling language. Experiments demonstrate the abilities of the system by creating a hybrid network of real and simulated neurons, and playing a pre-defined synaptic waveform into a synaptic conductance variable. We conclude by introducing a waveform reconstruction technique that is useful for establishing the presence of significant experimental error in implementations of the dynamic clamp protocol.},

abstract = {When a rate histogram is used to represent the firing pattern of a neuron there is the potential for serious error due to aliasing, and because of this the rate histogram is a very poor way to represent neural activity. It is theoretically possible to encode a signal in a spike train and decode it without error by filtering and sampling. There is no natural optimal filter design for this problem, but it is possible to specify the characteristics of a good rate estimating filter heuristically and design a filter with these characteristics. Two rate estimating filters are described here. Their performance has been tested, and compared to the rate histogram and the French-Holden rate estimating algorithm, by measuring their ability to recover signals encoded as impulse sequences by Integral Pulse Frequency Modulation (IPFM). These filters are simple to implement and perform well. They should be used in preference to the rate histogram.},

title = {Dendritic calcium activity precedes inspiratory bursts in preBotzinger complex neurons},
abstract = {Medullary interneurons of the preB{\"o}tzinger complex assemble excitatory networks that produce inspiratory-related neural rhythms, but the importance of somatodendritic conductances in rhythm generation is still incompletely understood. Synaptic input may cause Ca(2+) accumulation postsynaptically to evoke a Ca(2+)-activated inward current that contributes to inspiratory burst generation. We measured Ca(2+) transients by two-photon imaging dendrites while recording neuronal somata electrophysiologically. Dendritic Ca(2+) accumulation frequently precedes inspiratory bursts, particularly at recording sites 50-300 μm distal from the soma. Preinspiratory Ca(2+) transients occur in hotspots, not ubiquitously, in dendrites. Ca(2+) activity propagates orthodromically toward the soma (and antidromically to more distal regions of the dendrite) at rapid rates (300-700 μm/s). These high propagation rates suggest that dendritic Ca(2+) activates an inward current to electrotonically depolarize the soma, rather than propagate as a regenerative Ca(2+) wave. These data provide new evidence that respiratory rhythmogenesis may depend on dendritic burst-generating conductances activated in the context of network activity.},

title = {Somatic EPSP amplitude is independent of synapse location in hippocampal pyramidal neurons},
abstract = {Most neurons receive thousands of synaptic inputs onto widely spread dendrites. Because of dendritic filtering, distant synapses should have less efficacy than proximal ones. To investigate this, we characterized the amplitude and kinetics of excitatory synaptic input across the apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons using dual whole-cell recordings. We found that dendritic EPSP amplitude increases with distance from the soma, counterbalancing the filtering effects of the dendrites and reducing the location dependence of somatic EPSP amplitude. Dendritic current injections and a multi-compartmental computer model demonstrated that dendritic membrane properties have only a minor role in elevating the local EPSP. Instead a progressive increase in synaptic conductance seems to be primarily responsible for normalizing the amplitudes of individual inputs.

title = {Phase response curve analysis of a full morphological globus pallidus neuron model reveals distinct perisomatic and dendritic modes of synaptic integration},
abstract = {Synchronization of globus pallidus (GP) neurons and cortically entrained oscillations between GP and other basal ganglia nuclei are key features of the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. Phase response curves (PRCs), which tabulate the effects of phasic inputs within a neuron's spike cycle on output spike timing, are efficient tools for predicting the emergence of synchronization in neuronal networks and entrainment to periodic input. In this study we apply physiologically realistic synaptic conductance inputs to a full morphological GP neuron model to determine the phase response properties of the soma and different regions of the dendritic tree. We find that perisomatic excitatory inputs delivered throughout the interspike interval advance the phase of the spontaneous spike cycle yielding a type I PRC. In contrast, we demonstrate that distal dendritic excitatory inputs can either delay or advance the next spike depending on whether they occur early or late in the spike cycle. We find this latter pattern of responses, summarized by a biphasic (type II) PRC, was a consequence of dendritic activation of the small conductance calcium-activated potassium current, SK. We also evaluate the spike-frequency dependence of somatic and dendritic PRC shapes, and we demonstrate the robustness of our results to variations of conductance densities, distributions, and kinetic parameters. We conclude that the distal dendrite of GP neurons embodies a distinct dynamical subsystem that could promote synchronization of pallidal networks to excitatory inputs. These results highlight the need to consider different effects of perisomatic and dendritic inputs in the control of network behavior.},

To examine what kinds of signals can be carried by synchrony, I reproduced a multilayer feedforward network of neurons in an in vitro slice preparation of rat cortex using an iterative procedure. When constant and time-varying frequency signals were delivered to the network, the firing of neurons in successive layers became progressively more synchronous. Notably, synchrony in the in vitro network developed even with uncorrelated input, persisted under a wide range of physiological conditions and was crucial for the stable propagation of rate signals. The firing rate was represented by a classical rate code in the initial layers, but switched to a synchrony-based code in the deeper layers.},

Isolated rabbit atrioventricular nodal cells were coupled by an electronic circuit to a real-time simulation of an array of cell models. We investigated the critical size of an automatic focus for the activation of two-dimensional arrays made up of either ventricular or atrial model cells. Over a range of coupling conductances for the arrays, the critical size of the focus cell group for successful propagation was smaller for activation of an atrial versus a ventricular array. Failure of activation of the arrays at smaller focus sizes was due to the inhibition of pacing of the nodal cells. At low levels of coupling conductance, the ventricular arrays required larger sizes of the focus due to failure of propagation even when the focus was spontaneously active. The major differences between activation of the atrial and ventricular arrays is due to the higher membrane resistance (lower inward rectifier current) of the atrial cells.},

abstract = {Gain modulation is a prominent feature of neuronal activity recorded in behaving animals, but the mechanism by which it occurs is unknown. By introducing a barrage of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances that mimics conditions encountered in vivo into pyramidal neurons in slices of rat somatosensory cortex, we show that the gain of a neuronal response to excitatory drive can be modulated by varying the level of "background" synaptic input. Simultaneously increasing both excitatory and inhibitory background firing rates in a balanced manner results in a divisive gain modulation of the neuronal response without appreciable signal-independent increases in firing rate or spike-train variability.

title = {Calcium-activated nonspecific cation current and synaptic depression promote network-dependent burst oscillations},
abstract = {Central pattern generators (CPGs) produce neural-motor rhythms that often depend on specialized cellular or synaptic properties such as pacemaker neurons or alternating phases of synaptic inhibition. Motivated by experimental evidence suggesting that activity in the mammalian respiratory CPG, the preB{\"o}tzinger complex, does not require either of these components, we present and analyze a mathematical model demonstrating an unconventional mechanism of rhythm generation in which glutamatergic synapses and the short-term depression of excitatory transmission play key rhythmogenic roles. Recurrent synaptic excitation triggers postsynaptic Ca(2+)-activated nonspecific cation current (I(CAN)) to initiate a network-wide burst. Robust depolarization due to I(CAN) also causes voltage-dependent spike inactivation, which diminishes recurrent excitation and thus attenuates postsynaptic Ca(2+) accumulation. Consequently, activity-dependent outward currents-produced by Na/K ATPase pumps or other ionic mechanisms-can terminate the burst and cause a transient quiescent state in the network. The recovery of sporadic spiking activity rekindles excitatory interactions and initiates a new cycle. Because synaptic inputs gate postsynaptic burst-generating conductances, this rhythm-generating mechanism represents a new paradigm that can be dubbed a 'group pacemaker' in which the basic rhythmogenic unit encompasses a fully interdependent ensemble of synaptic and intrinsic components. This conceptual framework should be considered as an alternative to traditional models when analyzing CPGs for which mechanistic details have not yet been elucidated.},

title = {Statistics of subthreshold neuronal voltage fluctuations due to conductance-based synaptic shot noise},
abstract = {Neurons in the central nervous system, and in the cortex in particular, are subject to a barrage of pulses from their presynaptic populations. These synaptic pulses are mediated by conductance changes and therefore lead to increases or decreases of the neuronal membrane potential with amplitudes that are dependent on the voltage: synaptic noise is multiplicative. The statistics of the membrane potential are of experimental interest because the measurement of a single subthreshold voltage can be used to probe the activity occurring across the presynaptic population. Though the interpulse interval is not always significantly smaller than the characteristic decay time of the pulses, and so the fluctuations have the nature of shot noise, the majority of results available in the literature have been calculated in the diffusion limit, which is valid for high-rate pulses. Here the effects that multiplicative conductance noise and shot noise have on the voltage fluctuations are examined. It is shown that both these aspects of synaptic drive sculpt high-order features of the subthreshold voltage distribution, such as the skew. It is further shown that the diffusion approximation can only capture the effects arising from the multiplicative conductance noise, predicting a negative voltage skew for excitatory drive. Exact results for the full dynamics are derived from a master-equation approach, predicting positively skewed distributions with long tails in voltage ranges typical for action potential generation. It is argued that, although the skew is a high-order feature of subthreshold voltage distributions, the increased probability of reaching firing threshold suggests a potential role for shot noise in shaping the neuronal transfer function.},

title = {Persistent sodium current decreases transient gain in turtle motoneurons},
abstract = {Voltage dependent ion channels can influence signal integration in neurons dramatically. In addition to the classical fast-inactivating Na(+) current that mediates action potentials, many neurons also express persistent sodium current (I(NaP)). Activating at membrane potentials below the threshold for action potentials, this current may amplify excitatory postsynaptic potentials and shape the firing patterns. To determine the qualitative contribution of I(NaP) to the intrinsic firing properties of motoneurons, we eliminated this current by dynamic clamp. As expected, we found that elimination of I(NaP) shifted the rheobase to more positive currents. More interestingly, elimination of I(NaP) increased the steepness of initial frequency-to-current (fI) relation. This suggests that I(NaP) decreases the transient gain and broadens the integration window for short synaptic inputs in spinal motoneurons.},

Using an equivalent circuit mimicking simultaneous whole-cell voltage-clamp and cell-attached current-clamp recordings we have defined both mathematically and experimentally the relationship between the membrane patch resistance, the seal resistance, and the fraction of the whole-cell potential recorded across an intact membrane patch. This analysis revealed a steep increase in the accuracy of recording of steady-state membrane potential as the seal/membrane ratio increases from 0. The recording accuracy approaches 100% as the seal/membrane ratio approaches infinity. Membrane potential measurements across intact cell-attached patches in rat basophilic leukemia cells and rat megakaryocytes revealed a surprisingly high degree of accuracy and demonstrated the ability of this noninvasive technique to follow dynamic changes in potential in nonexcitable cells.},

title = {Contribution of motor neuron intrinsic properties to fictive motor pattern generation},
abstract = {Previously, we reported a canonical ensemble model of the heart motor neurons that underlie heartbeat in the medicinal leech. The model motor neurons contained a minimal set of electrical intrinsic properties and received a synaptic input pattern based on measurements performed in the living system. Although the model captured the synchronous and peristaltic motor patterns observed in the living system, it did not match quantitatively the motor output observed. Because the model motor neurons had minimal intrinsic electrical properties, the mismatch between model and living system suggests a role for additional intrinsic properties in generating the motor pattern. We used the dynamic clamp to test this hypothesis. We introduced the same segmental input pattern used in the model to motor neurons isolated pharmacologically from their endogenous input in the living system. We show that, although the segmental input pattern determines the segmental phasing differences observed in motor neurons, the intrinsic properties of the motor neurons play an important role in determining their phasing, particularly when receiving the synchronous input pattern. We then used trapezoidal input waveforms to show that the intrinsic properties present in the living system promote phase advances when compared to our model motor neurons. Electrical coupling between heart motor neurons also plays a role in shaping motor neuron output by synchronizing the activity of the motor neurons within a segment. These experiments provide a direct assessment of how motor neuron intrinsic properties interact with their premotor pattern of synaptic drive to produce rhythmic output.},

Understanding the detailed dynamics and precise neural code, even of a single neuron, is therefore a non-trivial task. Automated closed-loop approaches that integrate data analysis in the experimental design ease the investigation of sensory systems in three directions: First, adaptive sampling speeds up the data acquisition and thus increases the yield of an experiment. Second, model-driven stimulus exploration improves the quality of experimental data needed to discriminate between alternative hypotheses. Third, information-theoretic data analyses open up novel ways to search for those stimuli that are most efficient in driving a given neuron in terms of its firing rate or coding quality. Examples from different sensory systems show that, in all three directions, substantial progress can be achieved once rapid online data analysis, adaptive sampling, and computational modeling are tightly integrated into experiments.},

title = {Unscented Kalman filter for brain-machine interfaces},
abstract = {Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) are devices that convert neural signals into commands to directly control artificial actuators, such as limb prostheses. Previous real-time methods applied to decoding behavioral commands from the activity of populations of neurons have generally relied upon linear models of neural tuning and were limited in the way they used the abundant statistical information contained in the movement profiles of motor tasks. Here, we propose an n-th order unscented Kalman filter which implements two key features: (1) use of a non-linear (quadratic) model of neural tuning which describes neural activity significantly better than commonly-used linear tuning models, and (2) augmentation of the movement state variables with a history of n-1 recent states, which improves prediction of the desired command even before incorporating neural activity information and allows the tuning model to capture relationships between neural activity and movement at multiple time offsets simultaneously. This new filter was tested in BMI experiments in which rhesus monkeys used their cortical activity, recorded through chronically implanted multielectrode arrays, to directly control computer cursors. The 10th order unscented Kalman filter outperformed the standard Kalman filter and the Wiener filter in both off-line reconstruction of movement trajectories and real-time, closed-loop BMI operation.},

abstract = {Shaped by evolutionary processes, sensory systems often represent behaviorally relevant stimuli with higher fidelity than other stimuli. The stimulus dependence of neural reliability could therefore provide an important clue in a search for relevant sensory signals. We explore this relation and introduce a novel iterative algorithm that allows one to find stimuli that are reliably represented by the sensory system under study. To assess the quality of a neural representation, we use stimulus reconstruction methods. The algorithm starts with the presentation of an initial stimulus (e.g. white noise). The evoked spike train is recorded and used to reconstruct the stimulus online. Within a closed-loop setup, this reconstruction is then played back to the sensory system. Iterating this procedure, the newly generated stimuli can be better and better reconstructed. We demonstrate the feasibility of this method by applying it to auditory receptor neurons in locusts. Our data show that the optimal stimuli often exhibit pronounced sub-threshold periods that are interrupted by short, yet intense pulses. Similar results are obtained for simple model neurons and suggest that these stimuli are encoded with high reliability by a large class of neurons.},

A review of the current state of sensory neuroprostheses follows, with consideration of emerging data on the optimal configuration of micron-sized retinal prostheses as well as on the optimal site for stimulation of cells in the retina. Very recent findings on nanotechniques to enhance charge transfer from prosthesis to cell (neuronal or glial), that is, enhancement of the neural-electrical interface, are then reviewed.

title = {Artificial synaptic conductances reduce subthreshold oscillations and periodic firing in stellate cells of the entorhinal cortex},
abstract = {Previous work has established that stellate cells of the medial entorhinal cortex produce prominent intrinsic subthreshold oscillations in the voltage response concentrated within the theta range (3-7 Hz). It has been speculated that these oscillations play an important role in vivo in establishing network behavior both in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Consequently, it is important to investigate under what conditions theta oscillations in stellate cells can be generated and whether the spike-train power spectral density (PSD) also carries power at theta. We investigated the ability of stellate cells to generate theta oscillations in the presence of generic in vivo-like patterns of stimulation. Inputs were Poisson process-driven excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances or currents, introduced via dynamic clamp. We analyzed the subthreshold membrane oscillations and spike-train behavior in the presence of comparable synaptic conductance- or current-mediated membrane fluctuations. In the presence of conductance-based synapses, subthreshold oscillations are highly attenuated or entirely eliminated. Conversely, with current-based synapses stellate cells retain their ability to generate subthreshold oscillations in the theta band. These results also extend into the spiking regime, where only under current-based synapses does the PSD of the spike train show a prominent peak at theta. Furthermore, the peak in the spike-train PSD and spike clustering results from an increased probability of firing after a spike afterhyperpolarization and not directly from subthreshold oscillatory dynamics as has been previously suggested. Our results suggest that subthreshold oscillations may contribute less to in vivo response properties than has been hypothesized.},

title = {Characterization of a potassium-based leak conductance in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body},
abstract = {Principal neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) integrate the large, excitatory inputs from anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) bushy cells with conventional inhibitory inputs to produce an inhibitory output to the lateral and medial superior olive. This circuit is critical in the sound localization pathway of the auditory brainstem. Many ionic currents act in concert to produce the rapid phase-locked firing properties characteristic of MNTB principal neurons. We report here that MNTB neurons of the mouse possess a 2-4nS instantaneous potassium-based leak current, probably mediated by TWIK two-pore potassium leak channels. The function of the leak current was examined by modulating its magnitude with a dynamic clamp. The leak current modulates the resting voltage by 5mV/nS, reduces the input resistance of the cell by 5MOmega/nS and reduces the membrane time constant by 0.075 micros/nS. The leak current also modulates spike timing. Given leak channels are highly regulated, they are well placed to influence the firing properties, and action potential timing in principal neurons of the MNTB.},

title = {Timing and specificity of feed-forward inhibition within the LGN},
abstract = {Local interneurons provide feed-forward inhibition from retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to thalamocortical (TC) neurons, but questions remain regarding the timing, magnitude, and functions of this inhibition. Here, we identify two types of inhibition that are suited to play distinctive roles. We recorded excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs/IPSCs) in TC neurons in mouse brain slices and activated individual RGC inputs. In 34% of TC neurons, we identified EPSCs and IPSCs with identical thresholds that were tightly correlated, indicating activation by the same RGC. Such "locked" IPSCs occurred 1 ms after EPSC onset. The remaining neurons had only "nonlocked" inhibition, in which EPSCs and IPSCs had different thresholds, indicating activation by different RGCs. Nonlocked inhibition may refine receptive fields within the LGN by providing surround inhibition. In contrast, dynamic-clamp recordings suggest that locked inhibition improves the precision of synaptically evoked responses in individual TC neurons by eliminating secondary spikes.},

title = {Series resistance compensation for whole-cell patch-clamp studies using a membrane state estimator},
abstract = {Whole-cell patch-clamp techniques are widely used to measure membrane currents from isolated cells. While suitable for a broad range of ionic currents, the series resistance (R(s)) of the recording pipette limits the bandwidth of the whole-cell configuration, making it difficult to measure rapid ionic currents. To increase bandwidth, it is necessary to compensate for R(s). Most methods of R(s) compensation become unstable at high bandwidth, making them hard to use. We describe a novel method of R(s) compensation that overcomes the stability limitations of standard designs. This method uses a state estimator, implemented with analog computation, to compute the membrane potential, V(m), which is then used in a feedback loop to implement a voltage clamp; we refer to this as state estimator R(s) compensation. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we built an amplifier incorporating state estimator R(s) compensation. In benchtop tests, our amplifier showed significantly higher bandwidths and improved stability when compared with a commercially available amplifier. We demonstrated that state estimator R(s) compensation works well in practice by recording voltage-gated Na(+) currents under voltage-clamp conditions from dissociated neonatal rat sympathetic neurons. We conclude that state estimator R(s) compensation should make it easier to measure large rapid ionic currents with whole-cell patch-clamp techniques.},

title = {Developmental mechanisms for suppressing the effects of delayed release at the endbulb of Held},
abstract = {Delayed release of neurotransmitter, also called asynchronous release, is commonly observed at synapses, yet its influence on transmission of spike information is unknown. We examined this issue at endbulb of Held synapses, which are formed by auditory nerve fibers onto bushy cells in the cochlear nucleus. Endbulbs from CBA/CaJ mice aged P6-P49 showed prominent delayed release when driven at physiologically relevant rates. In bushy cells from mice before the onset of hearing (P6-P12), spikes were driven by delayed release up to 100 ms after presynaptic activity. However, no such spikes were observed in bushy cells from mice after the onset of hearing (>P14). Dynamic-clamp experiments indicated that delayed release can drive spikes in older bushy cells provided synchronous release is absent, suggesting that activity normally suppresses these spikes. Application of apamin or alpha-dendrotoxin revealed late spikes in older bushy cells, suggesting that postsynaptic activation of K(V)1.x and SK channels during spiking suppresses the subsequent effects of delayed release. The developmental upregulation of these potassium channels would be highly adaptive for temporally precise auditory processing. Furthermore, delayed release appeared to influence synchronous neurotransmitter release. Enhancement of delayed release using strontium was correlated with lower firing probability in current clamp and smaller synchronous EPSCs in voltage clamp. EGTA-AM had the opposite effects. These effects were consistent with delayed and synchronous release competing for a single vesicle pool. Thus delayed release apparently has negative presynaptic and postsynaptic consequences at the endbulb, which are partly mitigated by postsynaptic potassium channel expression.},

title = {Frequency control of a slow oscillatory network by a fast rhythmic input: pyloric to gastric mill interactions in the crab stomatogastric nervous system},
abstract = {The stomatogastic nervous system of the crab, Cancer borealis, produces a slow gastric mill rhythm and a fast pyloric rhythm. When the gastric mill rhythm is not active, stimulation of the modulatory commissural ganglion neuron 1 (MCN1) activates a gastric mill rhythm in which the lateral gastric (LG) neuron fires in antiphase with interneuron 1 (Int1). We present theoretical and experimental data that indicate that the period of the MCN1 activated gastric mill rhythm depends on the strength and time course of the MCN1 evoked slow excitatory synaptic potential (EPSP) in the LG neuron, and on the strength of inhibition of Int 1 by the pacemaker of the pyloric network. This work demonstrates a new mechanism by which a slow network oscillator can be controlled by a much faster oscillatory neuron or network and suggests that modulation of the slow oscillator can occur by direct action on the neurons and synapses of the slow oscillator, or indirectly by actions on the fast oscillator and its synaptic connection with the slow oscillator.},

title = {Extended dynamic clamp: controlling up to four neurons using a single desktop computer and interface},
abstract = {The dynamic clamp protocol allows an experimenter to simulate the presence of membrane conductances in, and synaptic connections between, biological neurons. Existing protocols and commercial ADC/DAC boards provide ready control in and between < or =2 neurons. Control at >2 sites is desirable when studying neural circuits with serial or ring connectivity. Here, we describe how to extend dynamic clamp control to four neurons and their associated synaptic interactions, using a single IBM-compatible PC, an ADC/DAC interface with two analog outputs, and an additional demultiplexing circuit. A specific C++ program, DYNCLAMP4, implements these procedures in a Windows environment, allowing one to change parameters while the dynamic clamp is running. Computational efficiency is increased by varying the duration of the input-output cycle. The program simulates < or =8 Hodgkin-Huxley-type conductances and < or =18 (chemical and/or electrical) synapses in < or =4 neurons and runs at a minimum update rate of 5 kHz on a 450 MHz CPU. (Increased speed is possible in a two-neuron version that does not need auxiliary circuitry). Using identified neurons of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion, we illustrate on-line parameter modification and the construction of three-member synaptic rings.},

title = {Retinogeniculate synaptic properties controlling spike number and timing in relay neurons},
abstract = {Retinal ganglion cells (RGC) transmit visual signals to thalamocortical relay neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus via retinogeniculate synapses. Relay neuron spike patterns do not simply reflect those of RGCs, but the mechanisms controlling this transformation are not well understood. We therefore examined synaptic properties controlling the strength and precision of relay neuron firing in mouse (p28-33) brain slices using physiological stimulation patterns and a combination of current clamp and dynamic clamp. In tonic mode (-55 mV), activation of single RGC inputs elicited stereotyped responses in a given neuron. In contrast, responses in different neurons varied from unreliable, to faithfully following, to a gain in the number of spikes. Dynamic clamp experiments indicated these different responses primarily reflected variability in the amplitudes of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and AMPA components. Each of these components played a distinct role in transmission. The AMPA component evoked a single precisely timed, short-latency spike per stimulus, but efficacy decreased during repetitive stimulation due to desensitization and depression. The NMDA component elicited longer-latency spikes and multiple spikes per stimulus and became more effective during repetitive stimuli that led to NMDA current summation. We found that in burst mode (-75 mV), where low-threshold calcium spikes are activated, AMPA and NMDA components and synaptic plasticity influenced spike number, but no combination enabled relay cells to faithfully follow the stimulus. Thus the characteristics of AMPA and NMDA currents, the ratio of these currents and use-dependent plasticity interact to shape how RGC activity is conveyed to relay neurons.},

title = {Dopamine modulation of two subthreshold currents produces phase shifts in activity of an identified motoneuron},
abstract = {1. The lateral pyloric (LP) neuron is a component of the 14-neuron pyloric central pattern generator in the stomatogastric ganglion of the spiny lobster, Panulirus interruptus. In the pyloric rhythm, this neuron fires rhythmic bursts of action potentials whose phasing depends on the pattern of synaptic inhibition from other network neurons and on the intrinsic postinhibitory rebound properties of the LP cell itself. Bath-applied dopamine excites the LP cell and causes its activity to be phase advanced in the pyloric motor pattern. At least part of this modulatory effect is due to dopaminergic modulation of the intrinsic rate of postinhibitory rebound in the LP cell. 2. The LP neuron was isolated from all detectable synaptic input. We measured the rate of recovery after 1-s hyperpolarizing current injections of varying amplitudes, quantifying the latency to the first spike following the hyperpolarizing prepulse and the interval between the first and second action potentials. Dopamine reduced both the first spike latency and the first interspike interval (ISI) in the isolated LP neuron. During the hyperpolarizating pre-steps, the LP cell showed a slow depolarizing sag voltage that was enhanced by dopamine. 3. We used voltage clamp to analyze dopamine modulation of subthreshold ionic currents whose activity is affected by hyperpolarizing prepulses. Dopamine modulated the transient potassium current IA by reducing its maximal conductance and shifting its voltage dependence for activation and inactivation to more depolarized voltages. This outward current is normally transiently activated after hyperpolarization of the LP cell, and delays the rate of postinhibitory rebound; by reducing IA, dopamine thus accelerates the rate of rebound of the LP neuron. 4. Dopamine also modulated the hyperpolarization-activated inward current Ih by shifting its voltage dependence for activation 20 mV in the depolarizing direction and accelerating its rate of activation. This enhanced inward current helps accelerate the rate of rebound in the LP cell after inhibition. 5. The relative roles of Ih and IA in determining the first spike latency and first ISI were explored using pharmacological blockers of Ih (Cs+) and IA [4-aminopyridine (4-AP)]. Blockade of Ih prolonged the first spike latency and first ISI, but only slightly reduced the net effect of dopamine. In the continued presence of Cs+, blockade of IA with 4-AP greatly shortened the first spike latency and first ISI. Under conditions where both Ih and IA were blocked, dopamine had no additional effect on the LP cell. 6. We used the dynamic clamp technique to further study the relative roles of IA and Ih modulation in dopamine's phase advance of the LP cell. We blocked the endogenous Ih with Cs+ and replaced it with a simulated current generated by a computer model of Ih. The neuron with simulated Ih gave curves relating the hyperpolarizing prepulse amplitude to first spike latency that were the same as in the untreated cell. Changing the computer parameters of the simulated Ih to those induced by dopamine without changing IA caused only a slight reduction in first spike latency, which was approximately 20% of the total reduction caused by dopamine in an untreated cell. Bath application of dopamine in the presence of Cs+ and simulated Ih (with control parameters) allowed us to determine the effect of altering IA but not Ih: this caused a significant reduction in first spike latency, but it was still only approximately 70% of the effect of dopamine in the untreated cell. Finally, in the continued presence of dopamine, changing the parameters of the simulated Ih to those observed with dopamine reduced the first spike latency to that seen with dopamine in the untreated cell. 7. We generated a mathematical model of the lobster LP neuron, based on the model of Buchholtz et al. for the crab LP neuron.},

abstract = {Much work now emphasizes the concept that interneuronal networks play critical roles in generating synchronized, oscillatory behavior. Experimental work has shown that functional inhibitory networks alone can produce synchronized activity, and theoretical work has demonstrated how synchrony could occur in mutually inhibitory networks. Even though gap junctions are known to exist between interneurons, their role is far from clear. We present a mechanism by which synchronized bunting fan be produced in a minimal network of mutually inhibitory and gap-junctionally coupled neurons. The bursting relies on the presence of persistent sodium and slowly inactivating potassium currents in the individual neurons. Both GABA(A) inhibitory currents and gap-junctional coupling are required for stable bursting behavior to be obtained. Typically, the role of gap-junctional coupling is focused on synchronization mechanisms. However, these results suggest that a possible role of gap-junctional coupling may lie in the generation and stabilization of bursting oscillatory behavior.},

title = {Synapse formation is associated with memory storage in the cerebellum},
abstract = {The idea that memory is encoded by means of synaptic growth is not new. However, this idea has been difficult to demonstrate in the mammalian brain because of both the complexity of mammalian behavior and the neural circuitry by which it is supported. Here we examine how eyeblink classical conditioning affects synapse number within the cerebellum; the brain region essential for long-term retention of the conditioned response. Results showed eyeblink-conditioned rats to have significantly more synapses per neuron within the cerebellar interpositus nucleus than both explicitly unpaired and untrained controls. Further analysis showed that the increase was caused by the addition of excitatory rather than inhibitory synapses. Thus, development of the conditioned eyeblink response is associated with a strengthening of inputs from precerebellar nuclei rather than from cerebellar cortex. These results demonstrate that the modifications of specific neural pathways by means of synaptogenesis contributes to formation of a specific memory within the mammalian brain.},

abstract = {In this paper, we revisit the issue of the utility of the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model for capturing neuron firing behaviors. It has been noted (e.g., see [6]) that the FHN model cannot exhibit certain interesting firing behaviors such as bursting. We illustrate that, by allowing time-varying parameters for the FHN model, one could overcome such limitations while still retaining the low order complexity of the FHN model. We also highlight the utility of the FHN model from an estimation perspective by presenting a novel parameter estimation method that exploits the multiple time scale feature of the FHN model, and compare the performance of this method with the Extended Kalman Filter through illustrative examples.},

title = {Postsynaptic currents in deep cerebellar nuclei},
abstract = {Postsynaptic currents were studied by whole cell recordings in visually identified large neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) in slices of 4- to 11-day-old mice. Spontaneous postsynaptic currents were abolished by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline and had a single-exponential decay with a mean time constant of 13.6 +/- 3.2 (SD) ms. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked in 48/56 neurons recorded. The addition of AMPA and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists together completely abolished all synaptic responses. In 1 mM [Mg(2+)](o) and at a holding potential of -60 mV, the peak amplitude of the NMDA component of the EPSC (NMDA-EPSC) was 83.2 +/- 21.2% of the AMPA component (AMPA-EPSC). This indicates that in DCN neurons, at a physiological [Mg(2+)](o) and at the resting membrane potential, NMDA receptors contribute to the synaptic signal. AMPA-EPSCs had a linear current-voltage relationship with a reversal potential of +2.3 +/- 0.4 mV and a single-exponential decay with a voltage-dependent time constant that at -60 mV was 7.1 +/- 3.3 ms. In 10 microM glycine and 1 mM [Mg(2+)](o), the I-V relationship of NMDA-EPSCs had a reversal potential of -0.5 +/- 3.3 mV and a maximal inward current at -33.4 +/- 5.8 mV. The apparent dissociation constant (K(D)) of Mg(2+) for the NMDA receptor-channel at -60 mV, measured by varying [Mg(2+)](o), was 135.5 +/- 55.3 microM, and when measured by fitting the I-V curves with a theoretical function, it was 169.9 +/- 119.5 microM. Thus in the DCN, NMDA receptors have a sensitivity to Mg(2+) that corresponds to subunits that are weakly blocked by this ion (epsilon 3 and epsilon 4) of which the DCN express epsilon 4. NMDA-EPSCs had a double-exponential decay with voltage-dependent time constants that at -60 mV were 20.2 +/- 8.9 and 136.4 +/- 62.8 ms. At positive voltages, the time constants were slower and their contributions were about equal, while in the negative slope conductance region of the I-V curve, the faster time constant became predominant, conferring faster kinetics to the EPSC. The weak sensitivity to Mg(2+) of NMDA receptors, together with a relatively fast kinetics, provide DCN neurons with strong excitatory inputs in which fast dynamic signals are relatively well preserved.},

title = {The origin of the complex spike in cerebellar Purkinje cells},
abstract = {Activation of the climbing fiber input powerfully excites cerebellar Purkinje cells via hundreds of widespread dendritic synapses, triggering dendritic spikes as well as a characteristic high-frequency burst of somatic spikes known as the complex spike. To investigate the relationship between dendritic spikes and the spikelets within the somatic complex spike, and to evaluate the importance of the dendritic distribution of climbing fiber synapses, we made simultaneous somatic and dendritic patch-clamp recordings from Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices. Injection of large climbing fiber-like synaptic conductances at the soma using dynamic clamp was sufficient to reproduce the complex spike, independently of dendritic spikes, indicating that neither a dendritic synaptic distribution nor dendritic spikes are required. Furthermore, we found that dendritic spikes are not directly linked to spikelets in the complex spike, and that each dendritic spike is associated with only 0.24 +/- 0.09 extra somatic spikelets. Rather, we demonstrate that dendritic spikes regulate the pause in firing that follows the complex spike. Finally, using dual somatic and axonal recording, we show that all spikelets in the complex spike are axonally generated. Thus, complex spike generation proceeds relatively independently of dendritic spikes, reflecting the dual functional role of climbing fiber input: triggering plasticity at dendritic synapses and generating a distinct output signal in the axon. The encoding of dendritic spiking by the post-complex spike pause provides a novel computational function for dendritic spikes, which could serve to link these two roles at the level of the target neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei.},

title = {Excitation-inhibition balance in the CA3 network - neuronal specificity and activity-dependent plasticity},
abstract = {Activation of the axons of the granule cells, the mossy fibers, excites pyramidal cells and interneurons in the CA3 area, which, in turn, inhibit pyramidal cells. The integration of the various inputs that converge onto CA3 cells has been studied by pharmacological dissection of either the excitatory or inhibitory components. This strategy has the disadvantage of partially isolating the recorded cell from the network, ignoring the sources and the impact of concurrent inputs. To overcome this limitation, we dissociated excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances by mathematical extraction techniques, and analysed the dynamics of the integration of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in pyramidal cells and stratum lucidum interneurons (Sl-Ints) of CA3. We have uncovered a shunting mechanism that decreases the responsiveness of CA3 output cells to mossy fiber input after a period of enhanced excitability. The activation of the dentate gyrus (DG) after applying a kindling-like protocol in vitro, or after producing one or several seizures in vivo, results in a graded and reversible increase of inhibitory conductances in pyramidal cells, while in Sl-Ints, an increase of excitatory conductances occurs. Thus, interneurons reach more depolarized membrane potentials on DG activation yielding a high excitatory postsynaptic potential-spike coupling, while the contrary occurs in pyramidal cells. This effective activation of feedforward inhibition is synergized by the emergence of direct DG-mediated inhibition on pyramidal cells. These factors force the synaptic conductance to peak at a potential value close to resting membrane potential, thus producing shunt inhibition and decreasing the responsiveness of CA3 output cells to mossy fiber input.},

To test whether, as has been suggested, this high in vivo variability could be due to the postsynaptic currents generated by independent synaptic inputs, we injected synthetic synaptic current into neocortical neurons in brain slices. We report that independent inputs cannot account for this high variability, but this variability can be explained by a simple alternative model of the synaptic drive in which inputs arrive synchronously. Our results suggest that synchrony may be important in the neural code by providing a means for encoding signals with high temporal fidelity over a population of neurons.},

title = {D2-like dopamine receptor-mediated modulation of activity-dependent plasticity at GABAergic synapses in the subthalamic nucleus},
abstract = {Reciprocally connected glutamatergic subthalamic nucleus (STN) and GABAergic external globus pallidus (GP) neurons normally exhibit weakly correlated, irregular activity but following the depletion of dopamine in Parkinson's disease they express more highly correlated, rhythmic bursting activity. Patch clamp recording was used to test the hypothesis that dopaminergic modulation reduces the capability of GABAergic inputs to pattern 'pathological' activity in STN neurons. Electrically evoked GABA(A) receptor-mediated IPSCs exhibited activity-dependent plasticity in STN neurons, i.e. IPSCs evoked at frequencies between 1 and 50 Hz exhibited depression that increased with the frequency of activity. Dopamine, the D(2)-like dopamine receptor agonist quinpirole and external media containing a low [Ca(2+)] reduced both the magnitude of IPSCs evoked at 1-50 Hz and synaptic depression at 10-50 Hz. Dopamine/quinpirole also reduced the frequency but not the amplitude of miniature IPSCs recorded in the presence of tetrodotoxin. D(1)-like and D(4) agonists were ineffective and D(2/3) but not D4 receptor antagonists reversed the effects of dopamine or quinpirole. Together these data suggest that presynaptic D(2/3) dopamine receptors modulate the short-term dynamics of GABAergic transmission in the STN by lowering the initial probability of transmitter release. Simulated GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic conductances representative of control or modulated transmission were then generated in STN neurons using the dynamic clamp technique. Dopamine-modulated transmission was less effective at resetting autonomous activity or generating rebound burst firing than control transmission. The data therefore support the conclusion that dopamine acting at presynaptic D(2)-like receptors reduces the propensity for GABAergic transmission to generate correlated, bursting activity in STN neurons.},

title = {Coding of tactile response properties in the rat deep cerebellar nuclei},
abstract = {In the lateral hemispheres of the cerebellar cortex, somatosensory responses are represented in a finely grained fractured somatotopy. It is unclear, however, how these responses contribute to the ultimate output of the cerebellum from the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Robust responses of DCN neurons to somatosensory stimuli have been described, but a detailed examination of their somatotopic arrangement and stimulus coding properties is lacking. To address these questions, we recorded extracellular, single-unit activity in the DCN of ketamine-anesthetized rats in response to air-puff stimuli aimed at six different orofacial and forelimb locations. In additional experiments, the duration and intensity of air-puff stimuli to the ipsilateral upper lip were systematically varied. Overall, we found that DCN neuron responses to air puff stimuli showed combinations of three distinct response components: a short-latency spike response, a pronounced inhibition, and a long-latency increase in firing. Individual neurons responsive to air-puff stimulation exhibited any combination of just one, two, or all three of these response components. The inhibitory response was most common and frequently consisted of a complete cessation of spiking despite a high spontaneous rate of baseline firing. In contrast to published findings from cerebellar cortical recordings, the receptive fields of all responsive neurons in the DCN were large. In fact, the receptive field of most neurons covered the ipsi- and contralateral face as well as forepaws. Response properties of individual neurons did not reliably indicate stimulus intensity or duration, although as a population DCN neurons showed significantly increasing response amplitudes as air-puff intensity or duration increased. Overall, the responses were characterized by a distinct temporal profile in each neuron, which remained unchanged with changes in stimulus condition. We conclude that the responses in the DCN of rats to air-puff stimuli differ substantially from cerebellar cortical responses in their receptive field properties and do not provide a robust code of tactile stimulus properties. Rather, the characteristic temporal response profile of each neuron may be tuned to control the timing of a specific task to which its output is linked.},

Although its magnitude is <1% of the transient sodium current, I-NaP has functional significance because it is activated about 10 mV negative to the transient sodium current, where few voltage-gated channels are activated and neuron input resistance is high. I-NaP adds to synaptic current, and evidence indicates that it is present in dendrites where relatively small depolarizations will activate I-NaP, thereby increasing effectiveness of distal depolarizing synaptic activity. The mechanism for I-NaP is not known. Research in striated muscle and neurons suggests a modal change in gating of conventional sodium channels, but it is also possible that I-NaP flows through a distinct subtype of noninactivating sodium channels. Modulation of I-NaP could have a significant effect on the transduction of synaptic currents by neurons.},

title = {Rebound discharge in deep cerebellar nuclear neurons in vitro},
abstract = {Neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) play a critical role in defining the output of cerebellum in the course of encoding Purkinje cell inhibitory inputs. The earliest work performed with in vitro preparations established that DCN cells have the capacity to translate membrane hyperpolarizations into a rebound increase in firing frequency. The primary means of distinguishing between DCN neurons has been according to cell size and transmitter phenotype, but in some cases, differences in the firing properties of DCN cells maintained in vitro have been reported. In particular, it was shown that large diameter cells in the rat DCN exhibit two phenotypes of rebound discharge in vitro that may eventually help define their functional roles in cerebellar output. A transient burst and weak burst phenotype can be distinguished based on the frequency and pattern of rebound discharge immediately following a hyperpolarizing stimulus. Work to date indicates that the difference in excitability arises from at least the degree of activation of T-type Ca(2+) current during the immediate phase of rebound firing and Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channels that underlie afterhyperpolarizations. Both phenotypes can be detected following stimulation of Purkinje cell inhibitory inputs under conditions that preserve resting membrane potential and natural ionic gradients. In this paper, we review the evidence supporting the existence of different rebound phenotypes in DCN cells and the ion channel expression patterns that underlie their generation.},

title = {Thalamic T-type Ca2+ channels and NREM sleep},
abstract = {T-type Ca2+ channels play a number of different and pivotal roles in almost every type of neuronal oscillation expressed by thalamic neurones during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, including those underlying sleep theta waves, the K-complex and the slow (<1 Hz) sleep rhythm, sleep spindles and delta waves. In particular, the transient opening of T channels not only gives rise to the 'classical' low threshold Ca2+ potentials, and associated high frequency burst of action potentials, that are characteristically present during sleep spindles and delta waves, but also contributes to the high threshold bursts that underlie the thalamic generation of sleep theta rhythms. The persistent opening of a small fraction of T channels, i.e. I(Twindow), is responsible for the large amplitude and long lasting depolarization, or UP state, of the slow (<1 Hz) sleep oscillation in thalamic neurones. These cellular findings are in part matched by the wake-sleep phenotype of global and thalamic-selective CaV3.1 knockout mice that show a decreased amount of total NREM sleep time. T-type Ca2+ channels, therefore, constitute the single most crucial voltage-dependent conductance that permeates all activities of thalamic neurones during NREM sleep. Since I(Twindow) and high threshold bursts are not restricted to thalamic neurones, the cellular neurophysiology of T channels should now move away from the simplistic, though historically significant, view of these channels as being responsible only for low threshold Ca2+ potentials.},

title = {Short-term plasticity shapes the response to simulated normal and parkinsonian input patterns in the globus pallidus},
abstract = {Basal ganglia structures show strong activity modulation during movement and synchronous bursting in Parkinson's disease. Recent work has shown that short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) can play an important role in the effect of temporal activity patterns on postsynaptic targets. To determine the role of STP in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) to globus pallidus (GP) connection, which has been suggested to underlie rhythmical bursting in Parkinson's disease, we first measured STP using trains of electrical input stimulation in vitro. We found that STN inputs to GP typically show both facilitation and depression with input frequencies of 10-100 Hz and that facilitation is dominant for the first few inputs in a train but that depression takes over subsequently. We quantified the strength and time course of facilitation and depression using a computational model of STP. Using the STP model, we constructed synaptic conductance patterns of normal and Parkinsonian STN activity and applied these conductances to GP neurons in vitro using the technique of dynamic clamping. We show that STP controls the slope and shape of the function describing the steady-state level of GP neuron firing in response to different levels of STN input. In addition, we show that STP modulates responses of GP neurons to bursts and pauses in the input pattern. These findings indicate that STP plays an important role in modulating both spike rates and temporal patterns of GP activity in the normal state, as well as in Parkinson's disease.},

title = {EEG-fMRI fusion of paradigm-free activity using Kalman filtering},
abstract = {We address here the use of EEG and fMRI, and their combination, in order to estimate the full spatiotemporal patterns of activity on the cortical surface in the absence of any particular assumptions on this activity such as stimulation times. For handling such a high-dimension inverse problem, we propose the use of (1) a global forward model of how these measures are functions of the "neural activity" of a large number of sources distributed on the cortical surface, formalized as a dynamical system, and (2) adaptive filters, as a natural solution to solve this inverse problem iteratively along the temporal dimension. This estimation framework relies on realistic physiological models, uses EEG and fMRI in a symmetric manner, and takes into account both their temporal and spatial information. We use the Kalman filter and smoother to perform such an estimation on realistic artificial data and demonstrate that the algorithm can handle the high dimensionality of these data and that it succeeds in solving this inverse problem, combining efficiently the information provided by the two modalities (this information being naturally predominantly temporal for EEG and spatial for fMRI). It performs particularly well in reconstructing a random temporally and spatially smooth activity spread over the cortex. The Kalman filter and smoother show some limitations, however, which call for the development of more specific adaptive filters. First, they do not cope well with the strong nonlinearity in the model that is necessary for an adequate description of the relation between cortical electric activities and the metabolic demand responsible for fMRI signals. Second, they fail to estimate a sparse activity (i.e., presenting sharp peaks at specific locations and times). Finally their computational cost remains high. We use schematic examples to explain these limitations and propose further developments of our method to overcome them.},

abstract = {In mammalian spinal motoneurons (MNs), the slow component of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that follows the spike of each action potential is a major but not the sole determinant of the cells' firing rate. In this brief historical review, we emphasize four points about the AHP-firing rate relation. (1) There is a relatively sparse literature across vertebrates that directly addresses this topic. (2) After the advent of intracellular recording in the early 1950s, there was evidence from mammals to the contrary of an idea that subsequently became prevalent: that the high-firing rates attainable by spinal interneurons (INs) and low-threshold MNs was attributable to their small AHP at rheobase. (3) Further work is needed to determine whether our present findings on the AHP-firing rate relation of turtle cells generalize to the spinal neurons of other vertebrate species. (4) Relevant to point 3, substantial in vivo and in vitro work is potentially available in raw data used in reports on several mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates. In summary, the factors in addition to the slow AHP that help determine spinal INs and MN firing rate deserve further evaluation across vertebrates, with relevant data already potentially available in several laboratories.},

abstract = {To analyze the small-conductance calcium-dependent K current observed in dopaminergic neurons of the rat midbrain, we have developed a new dynamic current clamping method that incorporates recording of intracellular Ca levels. As reported earlier, blocking the small-conductance current with apamin shifted the firing modes of dopaminergic neurons and changed the firing rate and spike afterhyperpolarization. We modeled the kinetic properties of the current and assessed the model in a real-time computational system. Here, we show that the spike afterhyperpolarization is regulated by the small-conductance current, an effect that is observed in dopaminergic neurons. Thus, this current can effectively shape the autonomous firing patterns of dopaminergic neurons.},

title = {Predictions of phase-locking in excitatory hybrid networks: excitation does not promote phase-locking in pattern-generating networks as reliably as inhibition},
abstract = {Phase-locked activity is thought to underlie many high-level functions of the nervous system, the simplest of which are produced by central pattern generators (CPGs). It is not known whether we can define a theoretical framework that is sufficiently general to predict phase-locking in actual biological CPGs, nor is it known why the CPGs that have been characterized are dominated by inhibition. Previously, we applied a method based on phase response curves measured using inputs of biologically realistic amplitude and duration to predict the existence and stability of 1:1 phase-locked modes in hybrid networks of one biological and one model bursting neuron reciprocally connected with artificial inhibitory synapses. Here we extend this analysis to excitatory coupling. Using the pyloric dilator neuron from the stomatogastric ganglion of the American lobster as our biological cell, we experimentally prepared 86 networks using five biological neurons, four model neurons, and heterogeneous synapse strengths between 1 and 10,000 nS. In 77% of networks, our method was robust to biological noise and accurately predicted the phasic relationships. In 3%, our method was inaccurate. The remaining 20% were not amenable to analysis because our theoretical assumptions were violated. The high failure rate for excitation compared with inhibition was due to differential effects of noise and feedback on excitatory versus inhibitory coupling and suggests that CPGs dominated by excitatory synapses would require precise tuning to function, which may explain why CPGs rely primarily on inhibitory synapses.},

title = {Ca Currents Activated by Spontaneous Firing and Synaptic Disinhibition in Neurons of the Cerebellar Nuclei},
abstract = {In neurons of the cerebellar nuclei, long-term potentiation of EPSCs is induced by high-frequency synaptic excitation by mossy fibers followed by synaptic inhibition by Purkinje cells. Induction requires activation of synaptic receptors as well as voltage-gated Ca channels. To examine how Purkinje-mediated inhibition of nuclear neurons affects Ca levels during plasticity-inducing stimuli, we have combined electrophysiology, Ca imaging, and pharmacology of cerebellar nuclear neurons in mouse cerebellar slices. We find that spontaneous firing generates tonic Ca signals in both somata and dendrites, which drop during 500 ms, 100 Hz trains of Purkinje IPSPs or hyperpolarizing steps. Although the presence of low-voltage-activated (T-type) Ca channels in nuclear neurons has fostered the inference that disinhibition activates these channels, synaptic inhibition with a physiological chloride equilibrium potential (ECl) (-75 mV) fails to hyperpolarize neurons sufficiently for T-type channels to recover substantially. Consequently, after IPSPs, Ca signals return to baseline, although firing is accelerated by [~]20 Hz for [~]300 ms. Only after hyperpolarizations beyond ECl does Ca rise gradually beyond baseline, as firing further exceeds spontaneous rates. Cd2+ (100 {micro}M), which nearly eliminates L-type, N-type, P/Q-type, and R-type Ca currents while sparing approximately one-half the T-type current, prevents Ca changes during and after hyperpolarizations to ECl. Thus, high-frequency IPSPs in cerebellar nuclear neurons evoke little postinhibitory current through T-type channels. Instead, inhibition regulates Ca levels simply by preventing action potentials, which usually permit Ca influx through high-voltage-activated channels. The decreases and restoration of Ca levels associated with Purkinje-mediated inhibition are likely to contribute to synaptic plasticity.},

title = {Electrical interactions among real cardiac cells and cell models in a linear strand},
abstract = {Previous work with model systems for action potential conduction have been restricted to conduction between two real cells or conduction between a model cell and a real cell. The inclusion of additional elements to make a linear strand has allowed us to investigate the interactions between cells at a higher level of complexity. When, in the simplest case of a linear strand of three elements, the conductance between elements 2 and 3 (G(C2)) is varied, this affects the success or failure of propagation between elements 1 and 2 (coupled by G(C1)) as well as the success or failure of propagation between elements 2 and 3. Several major features were illustrated. 1)When G(C1) was only slightly greater than the coupling conductance required for successful propagation between a model cell and a real cell, addition of a third element of the strand either prevented conduction from element 1 to element 2 (when G(C2) was high) or allowed conduction from element 1 to element 2 but not conduction from element 2 to element 3 (when G(C2) was low). 2) For higher levels of G(C1), there was an allowable "window" of values of G(C2) for successful conduction from element 1 through to element 3. The size of this allowable window of G(C2) values increased with increasing values of G(C1), and this increase was produced by increases in the upper bound of G(C2) values. 3) When the size of the central element of the strand was reduced, this facilitated conduction through the strand, increasing the range of the allowable window of G(C2) values. The overall success or failure of conduction through a structure of cells that has a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of coupling conductances cannot be predicted simply by the average or the minimum value of coupling conductance but may depend on the actual spatial distribution of these conductances.},

title = {Regular patterns in cerebellar Purkinje cell simple spike trains},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC) in vivo are commonly reported to generate irregular spike trains, documented by high coefficients of variation of interspike-intervals (ISI). In strong contrast, they fire very regularly in the in vitro slice preparation. We studied the nature of this difference in firing properties by focusing on short-term variability and its dependence on behavioral state. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using an analysis based on CV(2) values, we could isolate precise regular spiking patterns, lasting up to hundreds of milliseconds, in PC simple spike trains recorded in both anesthetized and awake rodents. Regular spike patterns, defined by low variability of successive ISIs, comprised over half of the spikes, showed a wide range of mean ISIs, and were affected by behavioral state and tactile stimulation. Interestingly, regular patterns often coincided in nearby Purkinje cells without precise synchronization of individual spikes. Regular patterns exclusively appeared during the up state of the PC membrane potential, while single ISIs occurred both during up and down states. Possible functional consequences of regular spike patterns were investigated by modeling the synaptic conductance in neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Simulations showed that these regular patterns caused epochs of relatively constant synaptic conductance in DCN neurons. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings indicate that the apparent irregularity in cerebellar PC simple spike trains in vivo is most likely caused by mixing of different regular spike patterns, separated by single long intervals, over time. We propose that PCs may signal information, at least in part, in regular spike patterns to downstream DCN neurons.},

title = {GABAergic synaptic communication in the GABAergic and non-GABAergic cells in the deep cerebellar nuclei},
abstract = {The deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) are the final integrative units of the cerebellar network. The strongest single afferent to the DCN is formed by GABAergic Purkinje neuron axons whose synapses constitute the majority of all synapses in the DCN, with their action strongly regulating the intrinsic activity of their target neurons. Although this is well established, it remains unclear whether all DCN cell groups receive a functionally similar inhibitory input. We previously characterized three types of mouse DCN neurons based on the expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase isoform 67 (GAD67), their active membrane properties and morphological features. Here we describe the GABAergic synapses in these cell groups and show that spontaneous GABAergic synaptic activity can be seen in all three cell types. Since the majority of DCN neurons fire action potentials spontaneously at high frequencies both in vivo and in vitro, we expected that spontaneous GABAergic synaptic activities mediated by intra-DCN synaptic connections could be uncovered by their sensitivity to TTX. However, TTX had little effect on spontaneous synaptic activity. It seems, therefore that functional GABAergic connectivity within the DCN is sparse and/or weak at least under our experimental conditions. Even though present in all cell types, the spontaneous GABAergic events showed significant differences between the cell types. The synaptic currents in GABAergic cells had lower amplitude, lower frequency and slower kinetics than those of non-GABAergic cells. These differences could not be sufficiently explained by considering only cell size differences or a differential GABA(A)-receptor alpha-subunit composition. Rather, the main differentiating factor appears to be the dendritic localization of GABAergic synapses in the GABAergic cells.},

title = {What is stochastic resonance? Definitions, misconceptions, debates, and its relevance to biology},
abstract = {Stochastic resonance is said to be observed when increases in levels of unpredictable fluctuations--e.g., random noise--cause an increase in a metric of the quality of signal transmission or detection performance, rather than a decrease. This counterintuitive effect relies on system nonlinearities and on some parameter ranges being "suboptimal". Stochastic resonance has been observed, quantified, and described in a plethora of physical and biological systems, including neurons. Being a topic of widespread multidisciplinary interest, the definition of stochastic resonance has evolved significantly over the last decade or so, leading to a number of debates, misunderstandings, and controversies. Perhaps the most important debate is whether the brain has evolved to utilize random noise in vivo, as part of the "neural code". Surprisingly, this debate has been for the most part ignored by neuroscientists, despite much indirect evidence of a positive role for noise in the brain. We explore some of the reasons for this and argue why it would be more surprising if the brain did not exploit randomness provided by noise--via stochastic resonance or otherwise--than if it did. We also challenge neuroscientists and biologists, both computational and experimental, to embrace a very broad definition of stochastic resonance in terms of signal-processing "noise benefits", and to devise experiments aimed at verifying that random variability can play a functional role in the brain, nervous system, or other areas of biology.},

title = {Linking synaptic plasticity and spike output at excitatory and inhibitory synapses onto cerebellar Purkinje cells},
abstract = {Understanding the relationship between synaptic plasticity and neuronal output is essential if we are to understand how plasticity is encoded in neural circuits. In the cerebellar cortex, motor learning is thought to be implemented by long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory parallel fiber (PF) to Purkinje cell synapses triggered by climbing fiber (CF) input. However, theories of motor learning generally neglect the contribution of plasticity of inhibitory inputs to Purkinje cells. Here we describe how CF-induced plasticity of both excitatory and inhibitory inputs is reflected in Purkinje cell spike output. We show that coactivation of the CF with PF input and interneuron input leads not only to LTD of PF synapses but also to comparable, "balanced" LTD of evoked inhibitory inputs. These two forms of plasticity have opposite effects on the spike output of Purkinje cells, with the number and timing of spikes sensitively reflecting the degree of plasticity. We used dynamic clamp to evaluate plasticity-induced changes in spike responses to sequences of excitation and feedforward inhibition of varied relative and absolute amplitude. Balanced LTD of both excitatory and inhibitory components decreased the net spike output of Purkinje cells only for inputs with small inhibitory components, whereas for inputs with a larger proportion of feedforward inhibition CF-triggered LTD resulted in an increase in the net spike output. Thus, the net effect of CF-triggered plasticity on Purkinje cell output depends on the balance of excitation and feedforward inhibition and can paradoxically increase cerebellar output, contrary to current theories of cerebellar motor learning.},

title = {The rhythmic consequences of ion channel stochasticity},
abstract = {Ion channels are membrane-spanning proteins with central pores through which ions cross neuronal membranes. The pores through each ion channel flicker between open and closed states, starting and stopping the flow of ions and the electrical current they carry. Hence the current flickers on and off, varying widely on very short time scales. Recent evidence suggests that this noisy current is a source of rhythmic behaviors in neurons. In this review, we begin by providing an illustrative model that links the stochastic flicker of ion channels to neuronal rhythms. The author explores recent experimental work that shows channel flicker is necessary for at least one rhythm that characterizes a class of cortical neurons in vitro. Finally, the author highlights a number of novel studies that link ion channel stochasticity to neuronal rhythmic behaviors in other interesting ways.},

title = {Voltage- and site-dependent control of the somatic impact of dendritic IPSPs},
abstract = {Inhibitory interneurons target specific subcellular compartments of cortical pyramidal neurons, where location-specific interactions of IPSPs with voltage-activated ion channels are likely to influence the inhibitory control of neuronal output. To investigate this, we simulated IPSPs as a conductance source at sites across the somato-apical dendritic axis (up to 750 microm) of neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Analysis revealed that the electrotonic architecture of cortical pyramidal neurons is highly voltage dependent, resulting in a significant site-dependent disparity between the amplitude, kinetics, and dendro-somatic attenuation of IPSPs generated from depolarized (-50 mV) and hyperpolarized (-80 mV) membrane potentials. At the soma, the time course of IPSPs evoked from depolarized potentials was greatest when generated from proximal dendritic sites and decreased as events were generated more distally, whereas the somatic time course of IPSPs evoked from hyperpolarized potentials was independent of the dendritic site of generation. This behavior resulted from the concerted actions of axo-somatic sodium channels that increased the duration of proximal dendritic IPSPs generated at depolarized potentials and distal dendritic hyperpolarization-activated channels that mediated site independence of somatic IPSP time course at hyperpolarized potentials. Functionally, this voltage-dependent control of IPSPs shaped the spatial and temporal profile of inhibition of axonal action potential firing and dendritic spike generation. Together, these findings demonstrate that the somatic impact of dendritic IPSPs is highly voltage dependent and controlled by classes of ion channels differentially distributed across axodendritic domains, directly revealing site-dependent inhibitory synaptic processing in cortical pyramidal neurons.},

title = {Capacitance compensation and bridge balance adjustment in intracellular recording from dendritic neurons},
abstract = {Under most experimental conditions in intracellular recording, the proper adjustment of the amplifier is essential for the interpretation of the signals recorded from neurons. It is considered possible to accurately align the capacitance compensation and bridge balance adjustments of the amplifier simultaneously with the recording of membrane potential of an impaled cell if a number of conditions are met. In the strictest sense, these conditions are met only if: (1) the neuron is isopotential and if its electrical behavior can be adequately described using a single exponential decay constant, and if (2) that decay time constant is much longer than that of the microelectrode. These conditions cannot usually be satisfied. Because intracellular adjustment of capacitance compensation and bridge balance is necessary in many circumstances, it is desirable, to know whether any of the methods for performing these adjustments are accurate when used under less strict constraints, and to assess the nature and degree of the error that can be expected when the constraints are ignored. The results of computer simulations of a simple intracellular recording amplifier, microelectrode and a dendritic neuron model consisting of an isopotential cell and terminated finite equivalent cylinder representation of the dendrites are presented here. These studies show that the introduction of fast components of the response to intracellular current transients by the redistribution of applied charge in dendrite neurons may sometimes make it impossible to correctly apply the conventional methods of capacitance compensation and bridge balance. If the high-frequency response of the intracellular recording amplifier has sufficient fidelity, however, these adjustments can be made to a sufficient degree of accuracy using the response to sine wave calibration signals of varying frequency.},

title = {Specific T-type calcium channel isoforms are associated with distinct burst phenotypes in deep cerebellar nuclear neurons},
abstract = {T-type calcium channels are thought to transform neuronal output to a burst mode by generating low voltage-activated (LVA) calcium currents and rebound burst discharge. In this study we assess the expression pattern of the three different T-type channel isoforms (Ca(v)3.1, Ca(v)3.2, and Ca(v)3.3) in cerebellar neurons and focus on their potential role in generating LVA spikes and rebound discharge in deep cerebellar nuclear (DCN) neurons. We detected expression of one or more Ca(v)3 channel isoforms in a wide range of cerebellar neurons and selective expression of different isoforms in DCN cells. We further identify two classes of large-diameter DCN neurons that exhibit either a strong or weak capability for rebound discharge, despite the ability to generate LVA spikes when calcium currents are pharmacologically isolated. By correlating the Ca(v)3 channel expression pattern with the electrophysiological profile of identified DCN cells, we show that Ca(v)3.1 channels are expressed in isolation in DCN-burst cells, whereas Ca(v)3.3 is expressed in DCN-weak burst cells. Ca(v)3.1-expressing DCN cells correspond to excitatory or GABAergic neurons, whereas Ca(v)3.3-expressing cells are non-GABAergic. The Ca(v)3 class of LVA calcium channels is thus expressed in specific combinations in a wide range of cerebellar neurons but contributes to rebound burst discharge in only a select number of cell classes.},

Here, we address a basic question of spike train formation: how do perithreshold synaptic inputs perturb the output of a spiking neuron? We recorded from single entorhinal principal cells in vitro and drove them to spike steadily at ∼5 Hz (theta range) with direct current injection, then used a dynamic-clamp to superimpose strong excitatory conductance inputs at varying rates. Neurons spiked most reliably when the input rate matched the intrinsic neuronal firing rate. We also found a striking tendency of neurons to preserve their rates and coefficients of variation, independently of input rates. As mechanisms for this rate maintenance, we show that the efficacy of the conductance inputs varied with the relationship of input rate to neuronal firing rate, and with the arrival time of the input within the natural period. Using a novel method of spike classification, we developed a minimal Markov model that reproduced the measured statistics of the output spike trains and thus allowed us to identify and compare contributions to the rate maintenance and resonance. We suggest that the strength of rate maintenance may be used as a new categorization scheme for neuronal response and note that individual intrinsic spiking mechanisms may play a significant role in forming the rhythmic spike trains of activated neurons; in the entorhinal cortex, individual pacemakers may dominate production of the regional theta rhythm.},

title = {Dynamic spike thresholds during synaptic integration preserve and enhance temporal response properties in the avian cochlear nucleus},
abstract = {Neurons of the cochlear nuclei are anatomically and physiologically specialized to optimally encode temporal and spectral information about sound stimuli, in part for binaural auditory processing. The avian cochlear nucleus magnocellularis (NM) integrates excitatory eighth nerve inputs and depolarizing GABAergic inhibition such that temporal fidelity is enhanced across the synapse. The biophysical mechanisms of this depolarizing inhibition, and its role in temporal processing, are not fully understood. We used whole-cell electrophysiology and computational modeling to examine how subthreshold excitatory inputs are integrated and how depolarizing IPSPs affect spike thresholds and synaptic integration by chick NM neurons. We found that both depolarizing inhibition and subthreshold excitatory inputs cause voltage threshold accommodation, nonlinear temporal summation, and shunting. Inhibition caused such large changes in threshold that subthreshold excitatory inputs were followed by a refractory period. We hypothesize that these large shifts in threshold eliminate spikes to asynchronous inputs, providing a mechanism for the enhanced temporal fidelity seen across the eighth nerve/cochlear nucleus synapse. Thus, depolarizing inhibition and threshold shifting hone the temporal response properties of this system so as to enhance the temporal fidelity that is essential for auditory perception.},

title = {Synaptic dynamics do not determine proper phase of activity in a central pattern generator},
abstract = {Rhythmic motor activity often requires neuronal output to the muscles to arrive in a particular sequence. At the pattern-generator level, this requires distinct activity phases in different groups of constituent neurons. The phase differences between rhythmically active neurons in a network are thought to arise from the interplay between their intrinsic properties and the temporal dynamics of synapses among these neurons. In the rhythmically active pyloric network of the lobster Panulirus interruptus, synaptic connections from the pacemaker ensemble to the follower neurons [lateral pyloric ( LP) and pyloric constrictor (PY)] are thought to be primarily responsible for the proper phase of activity (pacemaker-LP-PY) across all frequencies (0.5-2 Hz) of the pyloric rhythm. We test this hypothesis by characterizing the synapses from the pacemaker ensemble to the LP and PY neurons. Paired comparisons show that these two synapses are not significantly different in strength or in the extent of short-term depression. To examine the level to which intrinsic properties of the follower neurons determine their relative activity phase, we block all chemical synapses within the network and drive the LP and PY neurons rhythmically using artificial synaptic currents with identical strength and dynamics implemented with the dynamic-clamp technique. In response to these identical synaptic inputs, the LP and PY neurons maintain the proper relative phase of activity. These results strongly indicate that the relative phase of activity among these follower neurons within the pyloric network is not dictated by their synaptic inputs but is solely determined by their distinct intrinsic properties.},

title = {Synchronization of strongly coupled excitatory neurons: Relating network behavior to biophysics},
abstract = {Behavior of a network of neurons is closely tied to the properties of the individual neurons. We study this relationship in models of layer II stellate cells (SCs) of the medial entorhinal cortex. SCs are thought to contribute to the mammalian theta rhythm ( 4 - 12 Hz), and are notable for the slow ionic conductances that constrain them to fire at rates within this frequency range. We apply "spike time response" (STR) methods, in which the effects of synaptic perturbations on the timing of subsequent spikes are used to predict how these neurons may synchronize at theta frequencies. Predictions from STR methods are verified using network simulations. Slow conductances often make small inputs "effectively large"; we suggest that this is due to reduced attractiveness or stability of the spiking limit cycle. When inputs are ( effectively) large, changes in firing times depend nonlinearly on synaptic strength. One consequence of nonlinearity is to make a periodically firing model skip one or more beats, often leading to the elimination of the anti-synchronous state in bistable models. Biologically realistic membrane noise makes such "cycle skipping" more prevalent, and thus can eradicate bistability. Membrane noise also supports "sparse synchrony," a phenomenon in which subthreshold behavior is uncorrelated, but there are brief periods of synchronous spiking.},

title = {Using a hybrid neural system to reveal regulation of neuronal network activity by an intrinsic current},
abstract = {The generation of rhythmic patterns by neuronal networks is a complex phenomenon, relying on the interaction of numerous intrinsic and synaptic currents, as well as modulatory agents. To investigate the functional contribution of an individual ionic current to rhythmic pattern generation in a network, we constructed a hybrid system composed of a silicon model neuron and a heart interneuron from the heartbeat timing network of the medicinal leech. When the model neuron and a heart interneuron are connected by inhibitory synapses, they produce rhythmic activity similar to that observed in the heartbeat network. We focused our studies on investigating the functional role of the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (I(h)) on the rhythmic bursts produced by the network. By introducing changes in both the model and the heart interneuron, we showed that I(h) determines both the period of rhythmic bursts and the balance of activity between the two sides of the network, because the amount and the activation/deactivation time constant of I(h) determines the length of time that a neuron spends in the inhibited phase of its burst cycle. Moreover, we demonstrated that the model neuron is an effective replacement for a heart interneuron and that changes made in the model can accurately mimic similar changes made in the living system. Finally, we used a previously developed mathematical model (Hill et al. 2001) of two mutually inhibitory interneurons to corroborate these findings. Our results demonstrated that this hybrid system technique is advantageous for investigating neuronal properties that are inaccessible with traditional techniques.},

The ideal voltage clamp method is shown to be more stable than the nonideal case, in particular when used with the adaptive time-step method.

abstract = {The role of gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A))-receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in 1) generating rebound burst firing and 2) burst inhibition in thalamocortical (TC) relay cells and inhibitory neurons of nucleus reticularis thalami (nRt) was investigated. Experimental data from previous studies were used to generate artificial synaptic responses in neurons via a computer-driven dynamic clamp. On average, in nRt neurons trains of six or more 10-nS GABA(A) IPSPs generated rebound bursts of action potentials with a mean delay of 605 +/- 32 (SE) ms. In contrast, 10 IPSPs were required for rebound bursts in relay cells, and these occurred with a significantly shorter delay of 327 +/- 35 ms. Ca2+-dependent burst responses could be shunted by single IPSPs. Half-maximal burst inhibition was obtained in nRt cells when IPSP conductance was 1.5 times the whole cell input conductance. Burst shunting in TC cells was less effective and required a synaptic- to input-conductance ratio of 3. The relative time window of IPSP burst shunting was broader in nRt (approximately 20 ms) than TC cells (approximately 10 ms). We conclude that in nRt cells GABA(A)-dependent rebound burst responses would occur with a latency that is incompatible with pacemaking of fast (>3-Hz) thalamic rhythm generation such as spindles, yet burst inhibition is powerful. Therefore a likely role for reciprocal intra-nRt connectivity is to mediate lateral inhibition between nRt cells.},

We used this model clamp system to study synchronization of sinoatrial node cells with regard to the critical value of intercellular coupling conductance required for frequency entrainment and the common interbeat interval during frequency entrainment. This common interbeat interval lay between the intrinsic intervals of the real cell and the model cell, but was closer to that of the intrinsically faster beating cell. Critical coupling conductance increased with increasing difference in intrinsic interbeat interval of the real cell and the model cell and ranged between 50 and 300 pS in 11 hybrid cell pairs.},

abstract = {Neuronal gain control is important for processing information in the brain. Shunting inhibition is not thought to control gain since it shifts input-output relationships during tonic excitation rather than changing their slope. Here we show that tonic inhibition reduces the gain and shifts the offset of cerebellar granule cell input-output relationships during frequency-dependent excitation with synaptic conductance waveforms. Shunting inhibition scales subthreshold voltage, increasing the excitation frequency required to attain a particular firing rate. This reduces gain because frequency-dependent increases in input variability, which couple mean subthreshold voltage to firing rate, boost voltage fluctuations during inhibition. Moreover, synaptic time course and the number of inputs also influence gain changes by setting excitation variability. Our results suggest that shunting inhibition can multiplicatively scale rate-coded information in neurons with high-variability synaptic inputs.},

First, we examined the subcellular distribution of sodium channels using electron microscopic observations of immunoperoxidase and immunogold labeling. Voltage-gated sodium channels were found throughout GP dendrites and furthermore exhibited a specific clustering at sites of excitatory synaptic inputs. To examine the possibility that these channels could mediate dendritic spike generation, synaptic stimulation at visualized dendritic sites was performed during whole-cell recordings in vitro. These recordings revealed dendritic spike initiation in response to small excitatory inputs even for very distal stimulation sites. In contrast, subthreshold responses were mostly or fully attenuated at the soma for stimulation sites on distal dendrites. Computer simulations support the hypothesis that postsynaptic clustering of sodium channels allows dendritic triggering of spikes in response to inputs that would be too small to trigger a spike given uniformly distributed dendritic sodium channels. These findings indicate that postsynaptic sodium channel clustering is an effective mechanism to mediate a novel form of synaptic amplification and dendritic spike initiation. The ability of small amounts of excitation to trigger spikes in GP dendrites supports the prominent role of subthalamic input in the control of GP activity.},

title = {Optical mapping system with real-time control capability},
abstract = {Real-time, closed-loop intervention is an emerging experiment-control method that promises to provide invaluable new insight into cardiac electrophysiology. One example is the investigation of closed-loop feedback control of cardiac activity (e.g., alternans) as a possible method of preventing arrhythmia onset. To date, such methods have been investigated only in vitro using microelectrode systems, which are hindered by poor spatial resolution and are not well suited for atrial or ventricular tissue preparations. We have developed a system that uses optical mapping techniques and an electrical stimulator as the sensory and effector arms, respectively, of a closed-loop, real-time control system. The system consists of a 2,048 x 1 pixel line-scan charge-coupled device camera that records optical signals from the tissue. Custom-image processing and control software, which is implemented on top of a hard real-time operation system (RTAI Linux), process the data and make control decisions with a deterministic delay of <1 ms. The system is tested in two ways: 1) it is used to control, in real time, simulated optical signals of electrical alternans; and 2) it uses precisely timed, feedback-controlled initiation of antitachycardia pacing to terminate reentrant arrhythmias in an arterially perfused swine right ventricle stained with voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye 4{beta-[2-(di-n-butylamino)-6-napathy]vinyl}pyridinium (di-4-ANEPPS). Thus real-time control of cardiac activity using optical mapping techniques is feasible. Such a system is attractive because it offers greater measurement resolution than the electrode-based systems with which real-time control has been used previously.},

Schaffer collateral stimulation elicited subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) that opened voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels in the apical dendrites. The EPSP-activated sodium channels opened near the peak of the EPSP, whereas low voltage-activated calcium channels opened near the EPSP peak and during the decay phase. Dendritic high voltage-activated channels required somatic action potential generation or suprathreshold synaptic trains for activation. Dendritic voltage-gated channels are, therefore, likely to participate in dendritic integration of synaptic events.},

title = {Dendrosomatic voltage and charge transfer in rat neocortical pyramidal cells in vitro},
abstract = {Most excitatory synapses on neocortical pyramidal cells are located on dendrites, which are endowed with a variety of active conductances. The main origin for action potentials is thought to be at the initial segment of the axon, although local regenerative activity can be initiated in the dendrites. The transfer characteristics of synaptic voltage and charge along the dendrite to the soma remains largely unknown, although this is an essential determinant of neural input-output transformations. Here we perform dual whole-cell recordings from layer V pyramidal cells in slices from somatosensory cortex of juvenile rats. Steady-state and sinusoidal current injections are applied to characterize the voltage transfer characteristics of the apical dendrite under resting conditions. Furthermore, dendrosomatic charge and voltage transfer are determined by mimicking synapses via dynamic current-clamping. We find that around rest, the dendrite behaves like a linear cable. The cutoff frequency for somatopetal current transfer is around 4 Hz, i.e., synaptic inputs are heavily low-pass filtered. In agreement with linearity, transfer resistances are reciprocal in opposite directions, and the centroids of the synaptic time course are on the order of the membrane time constant. Transfer of excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) charge, but not peak amplitude, is positively correlated with membrane potential. We conclude that the integrative properties of dendrites in infragranular neocortical pyramidal cells appear to be linear near resting membrane potential. However, at polarized potentials charge transferred is voltage-dependent with a loss of charge at hyperpolarized and a gain of charge at depolarized potentials.},

title = {Analysis of real-time numerical integration methods applied to dynamic clamp experiments},
abstract = {Real-time systems are frequently used as an experimental tool, whereby simulated models interact in real time with neurophysiological experiments. The most demanding of these techniques is known as the dynamic clamp, where simulated ion channel conductances are artificially injected into a neuron via intracellular electrodes for measurement and stimulation. Methodologies for implementing the numerical integration of the gating variables in real time typically employ first-order numerical methods, either Euler or exponential Euler (EE). EE is often used for rapidly integrating ion channel gating variables. We find via simulation studies that for small time steps, both methods are comparable, but at larger time steps, EE performs worse than Euler. We derive error bounds for both methods, and find that the error can be characterized in terms of two ratios: time step over time constant, and voltage measurement error over the slope factor of the steady-state activation curve of the voltage-dependent gating variable. These ratios reliably bound the simulation error and yield results consistent with the simulation analysis. Our bounds quantitatively illustrate how measurement error restricts the accuracy that can be obtained by using smaller step sizes. Finally, we demonstrate that Euler can be computed with identical computational efficiency as EE.},

title = {Models of respiratory rhythm generation in the pre-Botzinger complex. I. Bursting pacemaker neurons},
abstract = {A network of oscillatory bursting neurons with excitatory coupling is hypothesized to define the primary kernel for respiratory rhythm generation in the pre-Botzinger complex (pre-BotC) in mammals. Two minimal models of these neurons are proposed. In model 1, bursting arises via fast activation and slow inactivation of a persistent Na+ current INaP-h. In model 2, bursting arises via a fast-activating persistent Na+ current I-NaP and slow activation of a K+ current I-KS. In both models, action potentials are generated via fast Na+ and K+ currents. The two models have few differences in parameters to facilitate a rigorous comparison of the two different burst-generating mechanisms. Both models are consistent with many of the dynamic features of electrophysiological recordings from pre-BotC oscillatory bursting neurons in vitro, including voltage-dependent activity modes (silence, bursting, and beating), a voltage-dependent burst frequency that can vary from 0.05 to >1 Hz, and a decaying spike frequency during bursting. These results are robust and persist across a wide range of parameter values for both models. However, the dynamics of model 1 are more consistent with experimental data in that the burst duration decreases as the baseline membrane potential is depolarized and the model has a relatively flat membrane potential trajectory during the interburst interval. We propose several experimental tests to demonstrate the validity of either model and to differentiate between the two mechanisms.},

title = {Differential arithmetic of shunting inhibition for voltage and spike rate in neocortical pyramidal cells},
abstract = {The main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian forebrain is gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), which acts through A and B type receptors. GABAA receptors mediate inhibition via an increase in membrane conductance (shunting) and/or membrane potential hyperpolarization. Shunting inhibition is thought to decrease the gain between neural input and output, and thus to act as a divisor, but may do so only below the spike threshold. To investigate the role of shunting inhibition in neocortical neurons, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from layer V pyramidal cells of somatosensory cortex in juvenile rats. Sub- and suprathreshold voltage responses were elicited by somatic step current injections and a shunting conductance was generated via a dynamic clamp. Increasing the dynamic clamp shunting conductance led to a parallel shift of the current-discharge curves and a reduced slope of the current-voltage relationship, i.e. a decrease of neural gain. Selective activation of GABAAA receptors with the competitive agonist isoguvacine or rises of endogenous GABA with the specific reuptake blocker nipecotic acid led to a proportional decrease of subthreshold membrane voltage, but a constant offset of discharge rates, thus acting like a shunting conductance. Similarly, isoguvacine and nipecotic acid decreased the gain of excitatory postsynaptic potentials. In all three experimental conditions, shunting inhibition divisively affected subthreshold voltages, while the time-averaged suprathreshold membrane potential was offset by a constant amount. I conclude that shunting inhibition in pyramidal cells has a dual impact on neural output: it is divisive for subthreshold voltages but subtractive for spike frequencies.},

abstract = {Local cortical networks in the prefrontal cortex and visual cortex are capable of spontaneously generating sustained activity for periods of seconds or longer. This sustained activity is generated through recurrent excitation between pyramidal cells that is controlled by feedback inhibition and can have both a rapid onset and a rapid offset. The period of activity is associated with a marked increase in neuronal responsiveness to the intracellular injection of current pulses, especially those of smaller amplitude. Independently mimicking the depolarization, increase in membrane conductance and increase in noise associated with sustained activity revealed that the depolarization is largely responsible for the increase in neuronal responsiveness, although an increase in membrane noise also facilitates responses to small inputs. These results indicate that the persistent activity associated with the performance of working memory tasks may be generated largely through recurrent networks. They also suggest that feedback pathways, such as those involved in selective attention, may exert a powerful influence on neuronal responsiveness through synaptic bombardment.},

title = {Excitatory muscarinic modulation strengthens virtual nicotinic synapses on sympathetic neurons and thereby enhances synaptic gain},
abstract = {Acetylcholine excites many neuronal types by binding to postsynaptic m1-muscarinic receptors that signal to ion channels through the G(q/11) protein. To investigate the functional significance of this metabotropic pathway in sympathetic ganglia, we studied how muscarinic excitation modulated the integration of virtual nicotinic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) created in dissociated bullfrog B-type sympathetic neurons with the dynamic-clamp technique. Muscarine (1 muM) strengthened the impact of virtual synapses by reducing the artificial nicotinic conductance required to reach the postsynaptic firing threshold from 20.9 +/- 5.4 to 13.1 +/- 3.1 nS. Consequently, postganglionic action potential output increased by 4-215% when driven by different patterns of virtual presynaptic activity that were chosen to reflect the range of physiological firing rates and convergence levels seen in amphibian and mammalian sympathetic ganglia. In addition to inhibiting the M-type K(+) conductance, muscarine activated a leak conductance in three of 37 cells. When this leak conductance was reproduced with the dynamic clamp, it also acted to strengthen virtual nicotinic synapses and enhance postganglionic spike output. Combining pharmacological M-conductance suppression with virtual leak activation, at resting potentials between -50 and -55 mV, produced synergistic strengthening of nicotinic synapses and an increase in the integrated postganglionic spike output. Together, these results reveal how muscarinic activation of a branched metabotropic pathway can enhance integration of fast EPSPs by modulating their effective strength. The results also support the hypothesis that muscarinic synapses permit faster and more accurate feedback control of autonomic behaviors by generating gain through synaptic amplification in sympathetic ganglia.},

title = {Postsynaptic Ca2+ influx mediated by three different pathways during synaptic transmission at a calyx-type synapse},
abstract = {Whole-cell recordings and Ca2+ flux measurements were made at a giant calyx-type synapse in rat brainstem slices to determine the contribution of glutamate receptor (GluR) channels and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) to postsynaptic Ca2+ influx during synaptic transmission. A single presynaptic action potential (AP) evoked an EPSP, followed by a single AP. The EPSP-AP sequence caused a postsynaptic Ca2+ influx of similar to 3.0 pC, primarily through VDCCs (similar to 70%) and NMDA-type (up to 30%) channels but also through AMPA-type (<5%) GluR channels. At -80 mV, the fractional Ca2+ current (P-f) mediated by AMPA receptor (AMPAR) and NMDA receptor (NMDAR) channels was 1.3 and 11-12%, respectively. Simulations of the time course of Ca2+ influx through GluR channels suggested that the small contribution of AMPAR channels occurred only during the first few milliseconds of an EPSP, whereas influx through NMDAR channels dominated later. The NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ influx was localized in regions covered by the presynaptic terminal, whereas the Ca2+ influx mediated by VDCCs was more homogeneously distributed. Because of the temporal and spatial differences, calcium ions entering through the three different pathways are likely to activate different intracellular targets in the postsynaptic cell.},

title = {Modulation of firing rate by background synaptic noise statistics in rat visual cortical neurons},
abstract = {It has been shown previously that background synaptic noise modulates the response gain of neocortical neurons. However, the role of the statistical properties of the noise in modulating firing rate is not known. Here, the dependence of firing rate on the statistical properties of the excitatory to inhibitory balance (EI) in cortical pyramidal neurons was investigated. Excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABA-ergic synaptic conductances were simulated as two stochastic processes and injected into individual neurons in vitro through use of the dynamic-clamp system. Response gain was significantly modulated as a function of the statistical interactions between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances. Firing rates were compared for noisy synaptic conductance steps by varying either the EI correlation or the relative delay between correlated E and I. When inhibitory synaptic conductances exhibited a short temporal delay (5 ms) relative to correlated excitatory synaptic conductances, the response gain was increased compared to noise with no temporal delay but with an equivalent degree of correlation. The dependence of neuronal firing rate on the EI delay of the noisy background synaptic conductance suggests that individual excitatory pyramidal neurons are sensitive to the EI balance of the synaptic conductance. Therefore, the statistical EI interactions encoded within the synaptic subthreshold membrane fluctuations are able to modulate neuronal firing properties.},

In the future, evolution of DBS technology may depend on several key areas, including better scientific understanding of its underlying mechanism of action, advances in high-spatial resolution imaging and development of novel electrophysiological and neurotransmitter microsensor systems.

Here, we compare the functional consequences of such plasticity at the synapse from the climbing fibre to the Purkinje cell in the cerebellum and at the synapse between the retinal ganglion cell and the thalamocortical relay neuron in the lateral geniculate nucleus. Despite superficial similarities between these two powerful synapses, they have distinctive synaptic plasticity. The climbing fibre synapse is highly reliable but accomplishes this through many synaptic specializations. However, the retinogeniculate synapse dynamically regulates the flow of visual information by using two types of receptor that have different types of plasticity. These synapses illustrate the important functional consequences of synaptic plasticity.},

abstract = {Breathing, chewing, and walking are critical life-sustaining behaviors in mammals that consist essentially of simple rhythmic movements. Breathing movements in particular involve the diaphragm, thorax, and airways but emanate from a network in the lower brain stem. This network can be studied in reduced preparations in vitro and using simplified mathematical models that make testable predictions. An iterative approach that employs both in vitro and in silico models argues against canonical mechanisms for respiratory rhythm in neonatal rodents that involve reciprocal inhibition and pacemaker properties. We present an alternative model in which emergent network properties play a rhythmogenic role. Specifically, we show evidence that synaptically activated burst-generating conductances-which are only available in the context of network activity-engender robust periodic bursts in respiratory neurons. Because the cellular burst-generating mechanism is linked to network synaptic drive we dub this type of system a group pacemaker.},

title = {Synaptic shunting by a baseline of synaptic conductances modulates responses to inhibitory input volleys in cerebellar Purkinje cells},
abstract = {When processing synaptic input in vivo, large neurons in the brain must cope with thousands of events each second. Much work has focused on the specific processing of synchronous excitatory input volleys, both in cerebellar and cerebral cortical research. Here we pursue the question of how a continuous background of ongoing 'noise' inputs interacts with the processing of synchronous inhibitory input volleys. Specifically we examine the processing of inhibitory input transients in cerebellar Purkinje cells, which by inducing pauses in Purkinje cell spike activity may lead to a disinhibition of the deep cerebellar nuclei and thus to cerebellar motor command signals. We use the technique of dynamic clamping in vitro to simulate controlled patterns of in vivo like background inputs. We use electrical stimulation of inhibitory interneurons in the deep or upper molecular layer to create inhibitory input transients that lead to spike pauses in Purkinje cell activity. These pauses were much longer in the absence than in the presence of background inputs applied with dynamic clamping. We found that a significant amount of the synaptic current elicited by electrical stimulation was shunted by the background inputs. The overall amount of background conductance as well as the pattern of background inputs modulated spike pause duration in a specific manner. This modulation by shunting may be employed in vivo to evaluate the salience of specific sensory input received by cerebellar cortex.},

abstract = {Alternation in the duration of consecutive cardiac action potentials (electrical alternans) may precipitate conduction block and the onset of arrhythmias. Consequently, suppression of alternans using properly timed premature stimuli may be antiarrhythmic. To determine the extent to which alternans control can be achieved in cardiac tissue, isolated canine Purkinje fibers were paced from one end using a feedback control method. Spatially uniform control of alternans was possible when alternans amplitude was small. However, control became attenuated spatially as alternans amplitude increased. The amplitude variation along the cable was well described by a theoretically expected standing wave profile that corresponds to the first quantized mode of the one-dimensional Helmholtz equation. These results confirm the wavelike nature of alternans and may have important implications for their control using electrical stimuli.},

title = {Network-state modulation of power-law frequency-scaling in visual cortical neurons},
abstract = {Various types of neural-based signals, such as EEG, local field potentials and intracellular synaptic potentials, integrate multiple sources of activity distributed across large assemblies. They have in common a power-law frequency-scaling structure at high frequencies, but it is still unclear whether this scaling property is dominated by intrinsic neuronal properties or by network activity. The latter case is particularly interesting because if frequency-scaling reflects the network state it could be used to characterize the functional impact of the connectivity. In intracellularly recorded neurons of cat primary visual cortex in vivo, the power spectral density of V(m) activity displays a power-law structure at high frequencies with a fractional scaling exponent. We show that this exponent is not constant, but depends on the visual statistics used to drive the network. To investigate the determinants of this frequency-scaling, we considered a generic recurrent model of cortex receiving a retinotopically organized external input. Similarly to the in vivo case, our in computo simulations show that the scaling exponent reflects the correlation level imposed in the input. This systematic dependence was also replicated at the single cell level, by controlling independently, in a parametric way, the strength and the temporal decay of the pairwise correlation between presynaptic inputs. This last model was implemented in vitro by imposing the correlation control in artificial presynaptic spike trains through dynamic-clamp techniques. These in vitro manipulations induced a modulation of the scaling exponent, similar to that observed in vivo and predicted in computo. We conclude that the frequency-scaling exponent of the V(m) reflects stimulus-driven correlations in the cortical network activity. Therefore, we propose that the scaling exponent could be used to read-out the "effective" connectivity responsible for the dynamical signature of the population signals measured at different integration levels, from Vm to LFP, EEG and fMRI.},

title = {The functional consequences of changes in the strength and duration of synaptic inputs to oscillatory neurons},
abstract = {We studied the effect of synaptic inputs of different amplitude and duration on neural oscillators by simulating synaptic conductance pulses in a bursting conductance-based pacemaker model and by injecting artificial synaptic conductance pulses into pyloric pacemaker neurons of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion using the dynamic clamp. In the model and the biological neuron, the change in burst period caused by inhibitory and excitatory inputs of increasing strength saturated, such that synaptic inputs above a certain strength all had the same effect on the firing pattern of the oscillatory neuron. In contrast, increasing the duration of the synaptic conductance pulses always led to changes in the burst period, indicating that neural oscillators are sensitive to changes in the duration of synaptic input but are not sensitive to changes in the strength of synaptic inputs above a certain conductance. This saturation of the response to progressively stronger synaptic inputs occurs not only in bursting neurons but also in tonically spiking neurons. We identified inward currents at hyperpolarized potentials as the cause of the saturation in the model neuron. Our findings imply that activity-dependent or modulator-induced changes in synaptic strength are not necessarily accompanied by changes in the functional impact of a synapse on the timing of postsynaptic spikes or bursts.},

abstract = {Previous experimental and computational work (for review, see White et al., 2000) has suggested that channel noise, generated by the stochastic flicker of voltage-gated ion channels, can be a major contributor to electrical membrane noise in neurons. In spiny stellate neurons of the entorhinal cortex, we remove the primary source of channel noise by pharmacologically blocking the native persistent Na+ conductance. Via the dynamic-clamp technique (Robinson and Kawai, 1993; Sharp et al., 1993), we then introduce virtual persistent Na+ channels into the membranes of the stellate neurons. By altering the mathematical properties of these virtual "knock-ins," we demonstrate that stochastic flicker of persistent Na+ channels is necessary for the existence of slow perithreshold oscillations that characterize stellate neurons. Channel noise also alters the ability of stellate neurons to phase lock to weak sinusoidal stimuli. These results provide the first direct demonstration that physiological levels of channel noise can produce qualitative changes in the integrative properties of neurons.},

title = {Kalman Filter Implementation With Improved Numerical Properties},
abstract = {This paper presents a new form of Kalman filter-the sigmaRho filter-useful for operational implementation in applications where stability and throughput requirements stress traditional implementations. The new mechanization has the benefits of square root filters in both promoting stability and reducing dynamic range of propagated terms. State standard deviations and correlation coefficients are propagated rather than covariance square root elements and these physically meaningful statistics are used to adapt the filtering for further ensuring reliable performance. Finally, all propagated variables can be scaled to predictable dynamic range so that fixed point procedures can be implemented for embedded applications. A sample problem from communications signal processing is presented that includes nonlinear state dynamics, extreme time-variation, and extreme range of system eigenvalues. The sigmaRho implementation is successfully applied at sample rates approaching 100 MHz to decode binary digital data from a 1.5-GHz carrier.},

title = {A simple model of dynamic interactions between respiratory centers},
abstract = {There is a general consensus that neurons responsible for the generation of a respiratory rhythm are located in the rostral ventrolateral medulla. However, there is still controversy regarding the necessary components for respiratory rhythm generation. Both inspiratory neurons in the preBotzinger Complex (preBOtC) and pre-inspiratory neurons located more rostrally to this anatomical structure referred to as the parafacial respiratory group (pFRG) have been proposed to be essential for respiratory rhythmogenesis. To study the dynamical interactions between preBOtC and pFRG neurons, we use a canonical model that describes each neuron population as a phase oscillator. We assume that the oscillators are weakly coupled with pFRG neurons providing stimulation to preBOtC neurons and preBOtC neurons providing inhibitory drive to pFRG neurons. In our mathematical study, we explore plausible mechanisms that may account for the complex interactions between I and pre-I neuron. In particular, we show that reduced excitability of inspiratory in preBOtC may lead to the phenomena known as "quantal slowing".},

title = {Remodeling of synaptic AMPA receptor subtype alters the probability and pattern of action potential firing},
abstract = {Changes in the subunit composition of postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors can be induced at CNS synapses by neural activity and under certain pathological conditions. Fear-induced incorporation of GluR2-containing receptors at cerebellar synapses selectively prolongs the decay time of synaptic currents, whereas a switch from GluR2-lacking to GluR2-containing receptors induced by parallel fiber stimulation reduces the amplitude in addition to lengthening the duration of EPSCs. Although it is often assumed that these two forms of synaptic plasticity will alter action potential (AP) firing in the postsynaptic neuron, this has not been directly tested. Using a dynamic current-clamp approach, we now show that the fear-induced increase in EPSC duration increases the size of EPSPs and thereby markedly enhances the AP firing probability. In contrast, the parallel fiber stimulation-triggered switch in GluR2 expression reduces the EPSP-AP coupling because of the decrease in the synaptic current amplitude. The switch also abolished the paired-pulse facilitation that arose from an activity and spermine-dependent unblock of GluR2-lacking receptors and hence reduced the ability of paired stimuli to evoke two consecutive APs. Therefore, fear-induced incorporation of GluR2 receptors enhances the EPSP-AP coupling, but the parallel fiber stimulation-triggered switch reduces both the EPSP-AP coupling and evoked AP doublets. In contrast to long-term potentiation and depression, which modify the amplitude of synaptic currents, this activity-induced change in AMPA receptor phenotype alters synaptic conductance waveform and postsynaptic short-term plasticity. These changes modulate both the probability and pattern of evoked AP firing via a fundamentally different mechanism from long-term potentiation and long-term depression.},

title = {Contribution of morphology and membrane resistance to integration of fast synaptic signals in two thalamic cell types},
abstract = {Thalamocortical cells (TCs) and interneurons (INs) in the lateral geniculate nucleus process visual information from the retina. The TCs have many short dendrites, whereas the INs have fewer and longer dendrites. Because of these morphological differences, it has been suggested that transmission of synaptic signals from dendritic synapses to soma is more efficient in TCs than in INs. However, a higher membrane resistance (R(m)) for the INs could, in theory, compensate for the attenuating effect of their long dendrites and allow distal synaptic inputs to significantly depolarize the soma. Compartmental models were made from biocytin filled TCs (n = 15) and INs (n = 3) and adjusted to fit the current- and voltage-clamp recordings from the individual cells. The confidence limits for the passive electrical parameters were explored by simulating the influence of noise, morphometric errors and non-uniform and active conductances. One of the useful findings was that R(m) was accurately estimated despite realistic levels of active conductance. Simulations to explore the somatic influence of dendritic synapses showed that a small (0.5 nS) excitatory synapse placed at different dendritic positions gave similar somatic potentials in the individual TCs, within the TC population and also between TCs and INs. A linear increase in the conductance of the synapse gave increases in somatic potentials that were more sublinear in INs than TCs. However, when the total synaptic conductance was increased by simultaneously activating many small, spatially distributed synapses, the INs converted the synaptic signals to soma potentials almost as efficiently as the TCs. Thus, INs can transfer fast synaptic signals to soma as efficiently as TCs except when the focal conductance is large.},

title = {A methodology for achieving high-speed rates for artificial conductance injection in electrically excitable biological cells},
abstract = {We present a novel approach to implementing the dynamic-clamp protocol (Sharp et al., 1993), commonly used in neurophysiology and cardiac electrophysiology experiments. Our approach is based on real-time extensions to the Linux operating system. Conventional PC-based approaches have typically utilized single-cycle computational rates of 10 kHz or slower. In thispaper, we demonstrate reliable cycle-to-cycle rates as fast as 50 kHz. Our system, which we call model reference current injection (MRCI); pronounced merci is also capable of episodic logging of internal state variables and interactive manipulation of model parameters. The limiting factor in achieving high speeds was not processor speed or model complexity, but cycle jitter inherent in the CPU/motherboard performance. We demonstrate these high speeds and flexibility with two examples: 1) adding action-potential ionic currents to a mammalian neuron under whole-cell patch-clamp and 2) altering a cell's intrinsic dynamics via MRCI while simultaneously coupling it via artificial synapses to an internal computational model cell. These higher rates greatly extend the applicability of this technique to the study of fast electrophysiological currents such fast a currents and fast excitatory/inhibitory synapses.},

title = {Parametric spectral analysis of nonstationary fluctuations of excitatory synaptic currents},
abstract = {We assessed on Monte-Carlo simulated excitatory post-synaptic currents the ability of autoregressive (AR)-model fitting to evaluate their fluctuations. AR-model fitting consists of a linear filter describing the process that generates the fluctuations when driven with a white noise. Its fluctuations provide a filtered version of the signal and have a spectral density depending on the properties of the linear filter. When the spectra of the non-stationary fluctuations of excitatory post-synaptic currents were estimated by fitting AR-models to the segments of current fluctuations, assumed to be stationary and independent, the parameter and spectral estimates were scattered. The scatter was much reduced if the time-variant AR-models were fitted using stochastic adaptive estimators (Kalman, recursive least squares and least mean squares). The ability of time-variant AR-models to accurately fit the current fluctuations was monitored by comparing the fluctuations with predicted fluctuations, and by evaluating the model-learning rate. The median frequency of current fluctuations, which could be rapidly tracked and estimated from the individual quantal events (either Monte-Carlo simulated or recorded from pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampus), rose during the rise phase, before declining to a lower steady-state level during the decay phase of quantal event, whereas the variance showed a broad peak. The closing rate of AMPA channels directly affects the steady-state median frequency, whereas the transient peak can be modulated by a variety of factors-number of molecules released, ability of glutamate molecules to re-enter the synaptic cleft, diffusion constant of glutamate in the cleft and opening rate of AMPA channels. In each case, the effect on the amplitude and decay time of mEPSCs and on the current fluctuations differs. Each factor thus leaves its own kinetic fingerprint arguing that the contribution of such factors can be inferred from the combined kinetic properties of individual mEPSCs.},

abstract = {Advances in modern neuroscience require the identification of principles that connect different levels of experimental analysis, from molecular mechanisms to explanations of cellular functions, then to circuits, and, ultimately, to systems and behavior. Here, we examine how synaptic organization of the sympathetic ganglia may enable them to function as use-dependent amplifiers of preganglionic activity and how the gain of this amplification may be modulated by metabotropic signaling mechanisms. The approach combines a general computational model of ganglionic integration together with experimental tests of the model using the dynamic clamp method. In these experiments, we recorded intracellularly from dissociated bullfrog sympathetic neurons and then mimicked physiological synapses with virtual computer-generated synapses. It thus became possible to analyze the synaptic gain by recording cellular responses to complex patterns of synaptic activity that normally arise in vivo from convergent nicotinic and muscarinic synapses. The results of these studies are significant because they illustrate how gain generated through ganglionic integration may contribute to the feedback control of important autonomic behaviors, in particular to the control of the blood pressure. We dedicate this paper to the memory of Professor Vladimir Skok, whose rich legacy in synaptic physiology helped establish the modern paradigm for connecting multiple levels of analysis in studies of the nervous system.},

title = {Mechanisms of sustained high firing rates in two classes of vestibular nucleus neurons: differential contributions of resurgent Na, Kv3, and BK currents},
abstract = {To fire at high rates, neurons express ionic currents that work together to minimize refractory periods by ensuring that sodium channels are available for activation shortly after each action potential. Vestibular nucleus neurons operate around high baseline firing rates and encode information with bidirectional modulation of firing rates up to several hundred Hz. To determine the mechanisms that enable these neurons to sustain firing at high rates, ionic currents were measured during firing by using the action potential clamp technique in vestibular nucleus neurons acutely dissociated from transgenic mice. Although neurons from the YFP-16 line fire at rates higher than those from the GIN line, both classes of neurons express Kv3 and BK currents as well as both transient and resurgent Na currents. In the fastest firing neurons, Kv3 currents dominated repolarization at all firing rates and minimized Na channel inactivation by rapidly transitioning Na channels from the open to the closed state. In slower firing neurons, BK currents dominated repolarization at the highest firing rates and sodium channel availability was protected by a resurgent blocking mechanism. Quantitative differences in Kv3 current density across neurons and qualitative differences in immunohistochemically detected expression of Kv3 subunits could account for the difference in firing range within and across cell classes. These results demonstrate how divergent firing properties of two neuronal populations arise through the interplay of at least three ionic currents.},

When isolated in vitro, this network spontaneously generates an inspiratory-related motor rhythm, with stable amplitude from cycle to cycle. We show that progressively elevating neuronal excitability in vitro causes periodic modulation of this inspiratory rhythm, evoking (in order): mixed-mode oscillations, quasiperiodicity, and ultimately disorganized aperiodic activity. Thus, the respiratory network oscillator follows a well defined sequence of behavioral states characterized by dynamical systems theory, which includes discrete stages of periodic and quasiperiodic amplitude modulation and progresses (according to theory) to aperiodic chaos-like behavior. We also observed periodic, mixed-mode periodic, and quasiperiodic breathing patterns in neonatal rodents and human infants in vivo, suggesting that breathing patterns generated by the intact nervous system reflect deterministic neural activity patterns in the underlying rhythm-generating network.},

Biologically realistic modeling is needed to test hypotheses about the mechanisms that govern these signals and how nervous system function emerges from the operation of these mechanisms. The NEURON simulation program provides a powerful and flexible environment for implementing such models of individual neurons and small networks of neurons. It is particularly useful when membrane potential is nonuniform and membrane currents are complex. We present the basic ideas that would help informed users make the most efficient use of NEURON.},

title = {Overexpression of a hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I-h) channel gene modifies the firing activity of identified motor neurons in a small neural network},
abstract = {The hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I-h) is widely distributed in excitable cells. I-h plays important roles in regulation of cellular excitability, rhythmic activity, and synaptic function. We previously showed that, in pyloric dilator (PD) neurons of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of spiny lobsters, I-h can be endogenously upregulated to compensate for artificial overexpression of the Shal transient potassium channel; this maintains normal firing properties of the neuron despite large increases in potassium current. To further explore the function of I-h in the pyloric network, we injected cRNA of PAIH, a lobster gene that encodes I-h, into rhythmically active PD neurons. Overexpression of PAIH produced a fourfold increase in Ih, although with somewhat different biophysical properties than the endogenous current. Compared with the endogenous I-h, the voltage for half-maximal activation of the PAIH-evoked current was depolarized by 10 mV, and its activation kinetics were significantly faster. This increase in I-h did not affect the expression of I-A or other outward currents. Instead, it significantly altered the firing properties of the PD neurons. Increased Ih depolarized the minimum membrane potential of the cell, reduced the oscillation amplitude, decreased the time to the first spike, and increased the duty cycle and number of action potentials per burst. We used both dynamic-clamp experiments, injecting the modeled PAIH currents into PD cells in a functioning STG, and a theoretical model of a two-cell network to demonstrate that the increased I-h was sufficient to cause the observed changes in the PD activity.},

abstract = {The cerebellum controls complex, coordinated, and rapid movements, a function requiring precise timing abilities. However, the network mechanisms that underlie the temporal organization of activity in the cerebellum are largely unexplored, because in vivo recordings have usually targeted single units. Here, we use tetrode and multisite recordings to demonstrate that Purkinje cell activity is synchronized by a high-frequency (approximately 200 Hz) population oscillation. We combine pharmacological experiments and modeling to show how the recurrent inhibitory connections between Purkinje cells are sufficient to generate these oscillations. A key feature of these oscillations is a fixed population frequency that is independent of the firing rates of the individual cells. Convergence in the deep cerebellar nuclei of Purkinje cell activity, synchronized by these oscillations, likely organizes temporally the cerebellar output.},

title = {Stimulus history reliably shapes action potential waveforms of cortical neurons},
abstract = {Action potentials have been shown to shunt synaptic charge to a degree that depends on their waveform. In this way, they participate in synaptic integration, and thus in the probability of generating succeeding action potentials, in a shape-dependent way. Here we test whether the different action potential waveforms produced during dynamical stimulation in a single cortical neuron carry information about the conductance stimulus history. When pyramidal neurons in rat visual cortex were driven by a conductance stimulus that resembles natural synaptic input, somatic action potential waveforms showed a large variability that reliably signaled the history of the input for up to 50 ms before the spike. The correlation between stimulus history and action potential waveforms had low noise, resulting in information rates that were three to four times larger than for the instantaneous spike rate. The reliable correlation between stimulus history and spike waveforms then acts as a local encoding at the single-cell level. It also directly affects neuronal communication as different waveforms influence the production of succeeding spikes via differential shunting of synaptic charge. Modeling was used to show that slow conductances can implement memory of the stimulus history in cortical neurons, encoding this information in the spike shape.},

title = {The control of rate and timing of spikes in the deep cerebellar nuclei by inhibition},
abstract = {Cerebellar nucleus neurons were recorded in vitro, and dynamic clamping was used to simulate inhibitory synaptic input from Purkinje cells likely to occur in vivo. Inhibitory input patterns with varying synaptic amplitudes and synchronicity were applied to determine how spike rate and spike timing can be controlled by inhibition. The excitatory input conductance was held constant to isolate the effect of dynamic inhibitory inputs on spiking. We found that the timing of individual spikes was controlled precisely by short decreases in the inhibitory conductance that were the consequence of synchronization between many inputs. The spike rate of nucleus neurons was controlled in a linear way by the rate of inhibitory inputs. The spike rate, however, also depended strongly on the amount of synchronicity present in the inhibitory inputs. An irregular spike train similar to in vivo data resulted from applied synaptic conductances when the conductance was large enough to overcome intrinsic pacemaker currents. In this situation subthreshold fluctuations in membrane potential closely followed the time course of the combined reversal potential of excitation and inhibition. This indicates that the net synaptic driving force for realistic input levels in vivo may be small and that synaptic input may operate primarily by shunting. The accurate temporal control of output spiking by inhibitory input that can be achieved in this way in the deep cerebellar nuclei may be particularly important to allow fine temporal control of movement via inhibitory output from cerebellar cortex.},

title = {Input-driven components of spike-frequency adaptation can be unmasked in vivo},
abstract = {Spike-frequency adaptation affects the response characteristics of many sensory neurons, and different biophysical processes contribute to this phenomenon. Many cellular mechanisms underlying adaptation are triggered by the spike output of the neuron in a feedback manner (e.g., specific potassium currents that are primarily activated by the spiking activity). In contrast, other components of adaptation may be caused by, in a feedforward way, the sensory or synaptic input, which the neuron receives. Examples include viscoelasticity of mechanoreceptors, transducer adaptation in hair cells, and short-term synaptic depression. For a functional characterization of spike-frequency adaptation, it is essential to understand the dependence of adaptation on the input and output of the neuron. Here, we demonstrate how an input-driven component of adaptation can be uncovered in vivo from recordings of spike trains in an insect auditory receptor neuron, even if the total adaptation is dominated by output-driven components. Our method is based on the identification of different inputs that yield the same output and sudden switches between these inputs. In particular, we determined for different sound frequencies those intensities that are required to yield a predefined steady-state firing rate of the neuron. We then found that switching between these sound frequencies causes transient deviations of the firing rate. These firing-rate deflections are evidence of input-driven adaptation and can be used to quantify how this adaptation component affects the neural activity. Based on previous knowledge of the processes in auditory transduction, we conclude that for the investigated auditory receptor neurons, this adaptation phenomenon is of mechanical origin.},

title = {Estimating action potential thresholds from neuronal time-series: new metrics and evaluation of methodologies},
abstract = {The estimation of action potential thresholds is a subjective process, which we quantified by surveying experienced electrophysiologists via a software application that allowed them to select action potential thresholds from several presented neuronal time series. Independent of this survey, we derived two nonparametric techniques for automating the detection of an action potential threshold from the time-series of intracellular recordings. Both methods start with a phase-space representation of the action potential (dV/dt versus V). Method I detects the maximum slope in the phase space, while Method II detects the maximum second derivative in the phase space. These two methods, as well as five additional methods in the literature, were tested on three data sets representing a variety of action potential shapes, the same three datasets that were used in the electrophysiologist survey. The database of user responses was used to provide an external benchmark against which to statistically evaluate all seven methods. Method II, as well as the curvature-based Methods VI and VII, provided the best results tracking both absolute and relative changes in threshold versus the other nonparametric methods (peak of second and third time derivatives). The one parametric method evaluated, detection of threshold crossing of the first temporal derivative, performed comparably to these methods, provided that an appropriate threshold was chosen. We conclude that Methods II, VI, and VII were the best methods evaluated due to their performance across a wide range of action potential shapes and the fact that they are nonparametric. Our user database of responses may be useful to other investigators interested in developing additional methods in that it quantifies what has often been a subjective estimate.},

title = {Switching in the activity state of an interneuron that controls coordination of the hearts in the medicinal leech (Hirudo medicinalis)},
abstract = {The rhythmically active heart interneuron HN(5) in the medicinal leech exhibits two distinct activity states, which have been associated with different coordination states of the two hearts. During the active state, it discharges high-frequency bursts of action potentials interrupted by rhythmic inhibitory input from other interneurons. In the inactive state, the same cell receives rhythmic inhibition but the membrane potential remains subthreshold between these volleys, producing few or no action potentials. We investigated differences in the membrane properties of the cell during the active and inactive states. The membrane potential in the active state oscillates on average between about -56 +/- 6 mV (S.D.) and -45 +/- 7 mV; the mean oscillation amplitude is 11 +/- 4 mV. In the inactive state, the membrane potential oscillates on average between -58 +/- 6 mV and -55 +/- 6 mV with a mean amplitude of 3 +/- 1 mV. The overall conductance of an HN(5) interneuron during the active state is approximately 10 nS lower than that during the inactive state, indicating that an outward current is turned off during the active state or turned on during the inactive state. This outward current is not voltage-dependent in the range -80 mV to -10 mV, as shown in voltage-clamp experiments by a linear current-voltage relationship. The reversal potential of this current is approximately -60 mV, indicating that chloride or potassium ions underlie the current. Using dynamic-clamp, we show that by adding an artificial current with a linear voltage-dependence (leak conductance) to an HN(5) interneuron (conductance 15 nS, reversal potential -60 mV), the cell can be transferred from its active to its inactive state.},

Such techniques have been used to control the behavior of in vitro excitable biological tissue, suggesting their potential for clinical utility. However, the feasibility of using such techniques to control physiological processes has not been demonstrated in humans. Here we show that nonlinear-dynamical control can modulate human cardiac electrophysiological dynamics by rapidly stabilizing an unstable target rhythm. Specifically, in 52/54 control attempts in five patients, we successfully terminated pacing-induced period-2 atrioventricular-nodal conduction alternans by stabilizing the underlying unstable steady-state conduction. This proof-of-concept demonstration shows that nonlinear-dynamical control techniques are clinically feasible and provides a foundation for developing such techniques for more complex forms of clinical arrhythmia.},

title = {Complexity in Neuronal Noise Depends on Network Interconnectivity},
abstract = {"Noise," or noise-like activity (NLA), defines background electrical membrane potential fluctuations at the cellular level of the nervous system, comprising an important aspect of brain dynamics. Using whole-cell voltage recordings from fast-spiking stratum oriens interneurons and stratum pyramidale neurons located in the CA3 region of the intact mouse hippocampus, we applied complexity measures from dynamical systems theory (i.e., 1/f ( γ ) noise and correlation dimension) and found evidence for complexity in neuronal NLA, ranging from high- to low-complexity dynamics. Importantly, these high- and low-complexity signal features were largely dependent on gap junction and chemical synaptic transmission. Progressive neuronal isolation from the surrounding local network via gap junction blockade (abolishing gap junction-dependent spikelets) and then chemical synaptic blockade (abolishing excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials), or the reverse order of these treatments, resulted in emergence of high-complexity NLA dynamics. Restoring local network interconnectivity via blockade washout resulted in resolution to low-complexity behavior. These results suggest that the observed increase in background NLA complexity is the result of reduced network interconnectivity, thereby highlighting the potential importance of the NLA signal to the study of network state transitions arising in normal and abnormal brain dynamics (such as in epilepsy, for example).},

title = {Analog-digital simulations of full conductance-based networks of spiking neurons with spike timing dependent plasticity},
abstract = {We introduce and test a system for simulating networks of conductance-based neuron models using analog circuits. At the single-cell level, we use custom-designed analog circuits (ASICs) that simulate two types of spiking neurons based on Hodgkin-Huxley like dynamics: "regular spiking" excitatory neurons with spike-frequency adaptation, and "fast spiking" inhibitory neurons. Synaptic interactions are mediated by conductance-based synaptic currents described by kinetic models. Connectivity and plasticity rules are implemented digitally through a real time interface between a computer and a PCI board containing the ASICs. We show a prototype system of a few neurons interconnected with synapses undergoing spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), and compare this system with numerical simulations. We use this system to evaluate the effect of parameter dispersion on the behavior of small circuits of neurons. It is shown that, although the exact spike timings are not precisely emulated by the ASIC neurons, the behavior of small networks with STDP matches that of numerical simulations. Thus, this mixed analog-digital architecture provides a valuable tool for real-time simulations of networks of neurons with STDP. They should be useful for any real-time application, such as hybrid systems interfacing network models with biological neurons.},

title = {Firing rate control of a neuron using a linear proportional-integral controller},
abstract = {Some electrophysiology experiments require periodically firing neurons. One example is when measuring a neuron's phase response curve (PRC) where a neuron is stimulated with a synaptic input and the perturbation in the neuron's period is measured as a function of when the stimulus is applied. However, even regular spiking cells have considerable variations in their period. These variations can be categorized into two types: jitter, which characterizes the rapid changes in interspike intervals (ISIs) from spike to spike, and drift, which is a slow change in firing rate over seconds. The jitter is removed by averaging the phase advance of a synaptic input applied at a particular phase several times. The drift over long time scales results in a systematic change in the period over the duration of the experiment which cannot be removed by averaging. To compensate for the drift of the neuron over minutes, we designed a linear proportional-integral (PI) controller to slowly adjust the applied current to a neuron to maintain the average firing rate at a desired ISI. The parameters of the controller were calculated based on a first-order discrete model to describe the relationship between ISI and current. The algorithm is demonstrated on pyramidal cells in the hippocampal formation showing ISIs from the neuron in an open loop (constant applied current) and a closed loop (current adjusted by a spike rate controller). The advantages of using the controller can be summarized as: (1) there is a reduction in the transient time to reach a desired ISI, (2) the drift in the ISI is removed allowing for long experiments at a desired spiking rate and (3) the variance is diminished by removing the slow drift. Furthermore, we implemented an auto-tuning algorithm that estimates in real time the coefficients for each clamped neuron. We also show how the controller can improve the PRC estimation. The program runs on Real-Time eXperiment Interface (RTXI), which is Linux-based software for real-time data acquisition and control applications.},

title = {Compensation for variable intrinsic neuronal excitability by circuit-synaptic interactions},
abstract = {Recent theoretical and experimental work indicates that neurons tune themselves to maintain target levels of excitation by modulating ion channel expression and synaptic strengths. As a result, functionally equivalent circuits can produce similar activity despite disparate underlying network and cellular properties. To experimentally test the extent to which synaptic and intrinsic conductances can produce target activity in the presence of variability in neuronal intrinsic properties, we used the dynamic clamp to create hybrid two-cell circuits built from four types of stomatogastric neurons coupled to the same model Morris-Lecar neuron by reciprocal inhibition. We measured six intrinsic properties (input resistance, minimum membrane potential, firing rate in response to +1 nA of injected current, slope of the frequency-current curve, spike height, and spike voltage threshold) of dorsal gastric, gastric mill, lateral pyloric, and pyloric dilator neurons from male crabs of the species Cancer borealis. The intrinsic properties varied twofold to sevenfold in each cell type. We coupled each biological neuron to the Morris-Lecar model with seven different values of inhibitory synaptic conductance and also used the dynamic clamp to add seven different values of an artificial h-conductance, thus creating 49 different circuits for each biological neuron. Despite the variability in intrinsic excitability, networks formed from each neuron produced similar circuit performance at some values of synaptic and h-conductances. This work experimentally confirms results from previous modeling studies; tuning synaptic and intrinsic conductances can yield similar circuit outputs from neurons with variable intrinsic excitability.},

abstract = {We studied preB{\"o}tzinger Complex (preB{\"o}tC) inspiratory interneurons to determine the cellular mechanisms that influence burst termination in a mammalian central pattern generator. Neonatal mouse slice preparations that retain preB{\"o}tC neurons generate respiratory motor rhythms in vitro. Inspiratory-related bursts rely on inward currents that flux Na(+), thus outward currents coupled to Na(+) accumulation are logical candidates for assisting in, or causing, burst termination. We examined Na(+)/K(+) ATPase electrogenic pump current (I(pump)), Na(+)-dependent K(+) current (I(K-Na)), and ATP-dependent K(+) current (I(K-ATP)). The pharmacological blockade of I(pump), I(K-Na), or I(K-ATP) caused pathological depolarization akin to a burst that cannot terminate, which impeded respiratory rhythm generation and reversibly stopped motor output. By simulating inspiratory bursts with current-step commands in synaptically isolated preB{\"o}tC neurons, we determined that each current generates approximately 3-8 mV of transient post-burst hyperpolarization that decays in 50-1600 ms. I(pump), I(K-Na), and - to a lesser extent - I(K-ATP) contribute to terminating inspiratory bursts in the context of respiratory rhythm generation by responding to activity dependent cues such as Na(+) accumulation.},

title = {The membrane potential waveform of bursting pacemaker neurons is a predictor of their preferred frequency and the network cycle frequency},
abstract = {Many oscillatory networks involve neurons that exhibit intrinsic rhythmicity but possess a large variety of voltage-gated currents that interact in a complex fashion, making it difficult to determine which factors control frequency. Yet these neurons often have preferred (resonance) frequencies that can be close to the network frequency. Because the preferred frequency results from the dynamics of ionic currents, it can be assumed to depend on parameters that determine the neuron's oscillatory waveform shape. The pyloric network frequency in the crab Cancer borealis is correlated with the preferred frequency of its bursting pacemaker neurons anterior burster and pyloric dilator (PD). We measured the preferred frequency of the PD neuron in voltage clamp, which allows control of the oscillation voltage range and waveforms (sine waves and realistic oscillation waveforms), and showed that (1) the preferred frequency depends on the voltage range of the oscillating voltage waveform; (2) the slope of the waveform near its peak has a strongly negative correlation with the preferred frequency; and (3) correlations between parameters of the PD neuron oscillation waveform and its preferred frequency can be used to predict shifts in the network frequency. As predicted by these results, dynamic clamp shifts of the upper or lower voltage limits of the PD neuron waveform during ongoing oscillations changed the network frequency, consistent with the predictions from the preferred frequency. These results show that the voltage waveform of oscillatory neurons can be predictive of their preferred frequency and thus the network oscillation frequency.},

title = {Mechanisms supporting transfer of inhibitory signals into the spike output of spontaneously firing cerebellar nuclear neurons in vitro},
abstract = {Cerebellar cortical signals are carried to their principal target, the deep cerebellar nuclear neurons (DCNs), via the inhibitory pathway formed by Purkinje cell (PC) axons. Two different intrinsic properties of DCNs, rebound excitation and automatic firing, have been proposed to support ensuing mechanisms for information transfer via inhibitory synapses. The efficacy of these mechanisms was investigated using whole-cell recordings of spontaneously firing DCNs in cerebellar slices. Results using current injection revealed that both mechanisms are effective in spontaneously firing DCNs but operate at different ranges of membrane potential. Rebound frequency was well correlated to the duration and amplitude of the preceding hyperpolarization. Activation of PC synapses with trains of stimuli few seconds long elicited rebound firing in all tested neurons, demonstrating that inhibition can elicit rebounds in DCNs held at their spontaneous membrane potential. Rebounds could be also elicited by single stimulus in a subset of neurons. The rebound frequency was significantly correlated to the synaptic stimulus strength, supporting the idea that rebound frequency may encode the amplitude of inhibition and thus serve to transfer inhibitory signals in the cerebellar circuit.},

title = {Patterns of Spontaneous Purkinje Cell Complex Spike Activity in the Awake Rat},
abstract = {The olivocerebellar system is known to generate periodic synchronous discharges that result in synchronous (to within 1 msec) climbing fiber activation of Purkinje cells (complex spikes) organized in parasagittally oriented strips. These results have been obtained primarily in anesthetized animals, and so the question remains whether the olivocerebellar system generates such patterns in the awake animal. To this end, multiple electrode recordings of crus 2a complex spike activity were obtained in awake rats conditioned to execute tongue movements in response to a tone. After removal of all movement- and tone-related activity, the remaining data were examined to characterize spontaneous complex spike activity in the alert animal. Spontaneous complex spikes occurred at an average firing rate of 1 Hz and a clear [approx]10 Hz rhythmicity. Analysis of the autocorrelograms using a rhythm index indicated that the large majority of Purkinje cells displayed rhythmicity, similar to that in the anesthetized preparation. In addition, the patterns of synchronous complex spike activity were also similar to those observed in the anesthetized preparation (i.e., simultaneous activity was found predominantly among Purkinje cells located within the same parasagittally oriented strip of cortex). The results provide unequivocal evidence that the olivocerebellar system is capable of generating periodic patterns of synchronous activity in the awake animal. These findings support the extrapolation of previous results obtained in the anesthetized preparation to the waking state and are consistent with the timing hypothesis concerning the role of the olivocerebellar system in motor coordination.},

title = {Real-time kinetic modeling of voltage-gated ion channels using dynamic clamp},
abstract = {We propose what to our knowledge is a new technique for modeling the kinetics of voltage-gated ion channels in a functional context, in neurons or other excitable cells. The principle is to pharmacologically block the studied channel type, and to functionally replace it with dynamic clamp, on the basis of a computational model. Then, the parameters of the model are modified in real time (manually or automatically), with the objective of matching the dynamical behavior of the cell (e.g., action potential shape and spiking frequency), but also the transient and steady-state properties of the model (e.g., those derived from voltage-clamp recordings). Through this approach, one may find a model and parameter values that explain both the observed cellular dynamics and the biophysical properties of the channel. We extensively tested the method, focusing on Na(v) models. Complex Markov models (10-12 states or more) could be accurately integrated in real time at >50 kHz using the transition probability matrix, but not the explicit Euler method. The practicality of the technique was tested with experiments in raphe pacemaker neurons. Through automated real-time fitting, a Hodgkin-Huxley model could be found that reproduced well the action potential shape and the spiking frequency. Adding a virtual axonal compartment with a high density of Na(v) channels further improved the action potential shape. The computational procedure was implemented in the free QuB software, running under Microsoft Windows and featuring a friendly graphical user interface.},

title = {A dynamic role for GABA receptors on the firing pattern of midbrain dopaminergic neurons},
abstract = {Dopaminergic neurons are subject to a significant background GABAergic input in vivo. The presence of this GABAergic background might be expected to inhibit dopaminergic neuron firing. However, dopaminergic neurons are not all silent but instead fire in single-spiking and burst firing modes. Here we present evidence that phasic changes in the tonic activity of GABAergic afferents are a potential extrinsic mechanism that triggers bursts and pauses in dopaminergic neurons. We find that spontaneous single-spiking is more sensitive to activation of GABA receptors than phasic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated burst firing in rat slices (P15-P31). Because tonic activation of GABA(A) receptors has previously been shown to suppress burst firing in vivo, our results suggest that the activity patterns seen in vivo are the result of a balance between excitatory and inhibitory conductances that interact with the intrinsic pacemaking currents observed in slices. Using the dynamic clamp technique, we applied balanced, constant NMDA and GABA(A) receptor conductances into dopaminergic neurons in slices. Bursts could be produced by disinhibition (phasic removal of the GABA(A) receptor conductance), and these bursts had a higher frequency than bursts produced by the same NMDA receptor conductance alone. Phasic increases in the GABA(A) receptor conductance evoked pauses in firing. In contrast to NMDA receptor, application of constant AMPA and GABA(A) receptor conductances caused the cell to go into depolarization block. These results support a bidirectional mechanism by which GABAergic inputs, in balance with NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory inputs, control the firing pattern of dopaminergic neurons.},

title = {Dendritic Low-Threshold Calcium Currents in Thalamic Relay Cells},
abstract = {The low-threshold calcium current (IT) underlies burst generation in thalamocortical (TC) relay cells and plays a central role in the genesis of synchronized oscillations by thalamic circuits. Here we have combined in vitro recordings and computational modeling techniques to investigate the consequences of dendritically located IT in TC cells. Simulations of a reconstructed TC cell were compared with the recordings obtained in the same cell to constrain the values of its passive parameters. T-current densities in soma and proximal dendrites were then estimated by matching the model to voltage-clamp recordings obtained in dissociated TC cells, which lack most of the dendrites. The distal dendritic T-current density was constrained by recordings in intact TC cells, which show 5-14 times larger peak T-current amplitudes compared with dissociated cells. Comparison of the model with the recordings of the same cell constrained further the T-current density in dendrites, which had to be 4.5-7.6 times higher than in the soma to reproduce all experimental results. Similar conclusions were reached using a simplified three-compartment model. Functionally, the model shows that the same amount of T-channels can lead to different bursting behaviors if they are exclusively somatic or distributed throughout the dendrites. In conclusion, this combination of models and experiments shows that dendritic T-currents are necessary to reproduce low-threshold calcium electrogenesis in TC cells. Dendritic T-current may also have significant functional consequences, such as an efficient modulation of thalamic burst discharges by corticothalamic feedback.},

title = {Consistency and diversity of spike dynamics in the neurons of bed nucleus of stria terminalis of the rat: a dynamic clamp study},
abstract = {Neurons display a high degree of variability and diversity in the expression and regulation of their voltage-dependent ionic channels. Under low level of synaptic background a number of physiologically distinct cell types can be identified in most brain areas that display different responses to standard forms of intracellular current stimulation. Nevertheless, it is not well understood how biophysically different neurons process synaptic inputs in natural conditions, i.e., when experiencing intense synaptic bombardment in vivo. While distinct cell types might process synaptic inputs into different patterns of action potentials representing specific "motifs" of network activity, standard methods of electrophysiology are not well suited to resolve such questions. In the current paper we performed dynamic clamp experiments with simulated synaptic inputs that were presented to three types of neurons in the juxtacapsular bed nucleus of stria terminalis (jcBNST) of the rat. Our analysis on the temporal structure of firing showed that the three types of jcBNST neurons did not produce qualitatively different spike responses under identical patterns of input. However, we observed consistent, cell type dependent variations in the fine structure of firing, at the level of single spikes. At the millisecond resolution structure of firing we found high degree of diversity across the entire spectrum of neurons irrespective of their type. Additionally, we identified a new cell type with intrinsic oscillatory properties that produced a rhythmic and regular firing under synaptic stimulation that distinguishes it from the previously described jcBNST cell types. Our findings suggest a sophisticated, cell type dependent regulation of spike dynamics of neurons when experiencing a complex synaptic background. The high degree of their dynamical diversity has implications to their cooperative dynamics and synchronization.},

title = {Context-dependent effects of NMDA receptors on precise timing information at the endbulb of Held in the cochlear nucleus},
abstract = {Many synapses contain both AMPA receptors (AMPAR) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR), but their different roles in synaptic computation are not clear. We address this issue at the auditory nerve fiber synapse (called the endbulb of Held), which is formed on bushy cells of the cochlear nucleus. The endbulb refines and relays precise temporal information to nuclei responsible for sound localization. The endbulb has a number of specializations that aid precise timing, including AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) with fast kinetics. Voltage-clamp experiments in mouse brain slices revealed that slow NMDAR EPSCs are maintained at mature endbulbs, contributing a peak conductance of around 10% of the AMPAR-mediated EPSC. During repetitive synaptic activity, AMPAR EPSCs depressed and NMDAR EPSCs summated, thereby increasing the relative importance of NMDARs. This could impact temporal precision of bushy cells because of the slow kinetics of NMDARs. We tested this by blocking NMDARs and quantifying bushy cell spike timing in current clamp when single endbulbs were activated. These experiments showed that NMDARs contribute to an increased probability of firing, shorter latency, and reduced jitter. Dynamic-clamp experiments confirmed this effect and showed it was dose-dependent. Bushy cells can receive inputs from multiple endbulbs. When we applied multiple synaptic inputs in dynamic clamp, NMDARs had less impact on spike timing. NMDAR conductances much higher than mature levels could disrupt spiking, which may explain its downregulation during development. Thus mature NMDAR expression can support the conveying of precise temporal information at the endbulb, depending on the stimulus conditions.},

abstract = {The pre-Botzinger complex (pBC) is a vital subcircuit of the respiratory central pattern generator. Although the existence of neurons with pacemaker-like bursting properties in this network is not questioned, their role in network rhythmogenesis is unresolved. Modeling is ideally suited to address this debate because of the ease with which biophysical parameters of individual cells and network architecture can be manipulated. We modeled the parameter variability of experimental data from pBC bursting pacemaker and nonpacemaker neurons using a modified version of our previously developed pBC neuron and network models. To investigate the role of pacemakers in networkwide rhythmogenesis, we simulated networks of these neurons and varied the fraction of the population made up of pacemakers. For each number of pacemaker neurons, we varied the amount of tonic drive to the network and measured the frequency of synchronous networkwide bursting produced. Both excitatory networks with all-to-all coupling and sparsely connected networks were explored for several levels of synaptic coupling strength. Networks containing only nonpacemakers were able to produce networkwide bursting, but with a low probability of bursting and low input and output ranges. Our results indicate that inclusion of pacemakers in an excitatory network increases robustness of the network by more than tripling the input and output ranges compared with networks containing no pacemakers. The largest increase in dynamic range occurs when the number of pacemakers in the network is greater than 20% of the population. Experimental tests of our model predictions are proposed.},

title = {Mixed mode oscillations in mouse spinal motoneurons arise from a low excitability state},
abstract = {We explain the mechanism that elicits the mixed mode oscillations (MMOs) and the subprimary firing range that we recently discovered in mouse spinal motoneurons. In this firing regime, high-frequency subthreshold oscillations appear a few millivolts below the spike voltage threshold and precede the firing of a full blown spike. By combining intracellular recordings in vivo (including dynamic clamp experiments) in mouse spinal motoneurons and modeling, we show that the subthreshold oscillations are due to the spike currents and that MMOs appear each time the membrane is in a low excitability state. Slow kinetic processes largely contribute to this low excitability. The clockwise hysteresis in the I-F relationship, frequently observed in mouse motoneurons, is mainly due to a substantial slow inactivation of the sodium current. As a consequence, less sodium current is available for spiking. This explains why a large subprimary range with numerous oscillations is present in motoneurons displaying a clockwise hysteresis. In motoneurons whose I-F curve exhibits a counterclockwise hysteresis, it is likely that the slow inactivation operates on a shorter time scale and is substantially reduced by the de-inactivating effect of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) current, thus resulting in a more excitable state. This accounts for the short subprimary firing range with only a few MMOs seen in these motoneurons. Our study reveals a new role for the AHP current that sets the membrane excitability level by counteracting the slow inactivation of the sodium current and allows or precludes the appearance of MMOs.},

abstract = {The hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) plays an important role in determining membrane potential and firing characteristics of neurons and therefore is a potential target for regulation of intrinsic excitability. Here we show that an increase in AMPA-receptor-dependent synaptic activity induced by alpha-latrotoxin or glutamate application as well as direct depolarization results in an increase in Ih recorded from cell-attached patches in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. This mechanism requires Ca2+ influx but not increased levels of cAMP. Artificially increasing Ih by using a dynamic clamp during whole-cell current clamp recordings results in reduced firing rates in response to depolarizing current injections. We conclude that modulation of somatic Ih represents a previously uncharacterized mechanism of homeostatic plasticity, allowing a neuron to control its excitability in response to changes in synaptic activity on a relatively short-term time scale.},

title = {Regulation of persistent activity by background inhibition in an in vitro model of a cortical microcircuit},
abstract = {We combined in vitro intracellular recording from prefrontal cortical neurons with simulated synaptic activity of a layer 5 prefrontal microcircuit using a dynamic clamp. During simulated in vivo background conditions, the cell responded to a brief depolarization with a sequence of spikes that outlasted the depolarization, mimicking the activity of a cell recorded during the delay period of a working memory task in the behaving monkey. The onset of sustained activity depended on the number of action potentials elicited by the cue-like depolarization. Too few spikes failed to provide enough NMDA drive to elicit sustained reverberations; too many spikes activated a slow intrinsic hyperpolarization current that prevented spiking; an intermediate number of spikes produced sustained activity. When high dopamine levels were simulated by depolarizing the cell and by increasing the amount of NMDA current, the cell exhibited spontaneous 'up-states' that terminated by the activation of a slow intrinsic hyperpolarizing current. The firing rate during the delay period could be effectively modulated by the standard deviation of the inhibitory background synaptic noise without significant changes in the background firing rate before cue onset. These results suggest that the balance between fast feedback inhibition and slower AMPA and NMDA feedback excitation is critical in initiating persistent activity and that the maintenance of persistent activity may be regulated by the amount of correlated background inhibition.},

abstract = {Ca(v)1.3 (alpha 1D) L-type Ca(2+) channels have been implicated in substantia nigra (SN) dopamine (DA) neuron pacemaking and vulnerability to Parkinson's disease. These effects may arise from the depolarizing current and cytoplasmic Ca(2+) elevation produced by Ca(v)1.3 channels at subthreshold membrane potentials. However, the assumption that the Ca(2+) selectivity of Ca(v)1.3 channels is essential has not been tested. In this study the properties of SN DA neuron L-type Ca(2+) channels responsible for driving pacemaker activity in juvenile rat brain slices were probed by replacing native channels blocked with the dihydropyridine nimodipine with virtual channels generated by dynamic clamp. Surprisingly, virtual L-type channels that mimic native and recombinant Ca(v)1.3 channels supported pacemaker activity even though dynamic clamp currents are not carried by Ca(2+). This effect is specific because pacemaker activity could not be restored by tonic current injection, virtual nonselective leak channels or virtual NMDA receptors, which share with L-type channels a negative slope conductance region in their current-voltage (I-V) curve. Altering virtual channels showed that the production of pacemaker activity depended on the characteristic voltage dependence of DA neuron L-type channels, while activation kinetics and reversal potential were not critical parameters. Virtual L-type channels also supported slow oscillatory potentials and enhanced firing rate during evoked bursts. Thus, Ca(v)1.3 channel voltage dependence, rather than Ca(2+) selectivity, drives pacemaker activity and amplifies bursts in SN DA neurons.},

abstract = {Functional stereotaxy was introduced in the late 1940s to reduce the morbidity of lobotomy in psychiatric disease by using more focal lesions. The advent of neuroleptics led to a drastic decline in psychosurgery for several decades. Functional stereotactic neurosurgery has recently been revitalized, starting with treatment of Parkinson's disease, in which deep brain stimulation (DBS) facilitates reversible focal neuromodulation of altered basal ganglia circuits. DBS is now being extended to treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions such as Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression and addiction. In this review, we discuss the concept that dysfunction of motor, limbic and associative cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops underlies these various disorders, which might now be amenable to DBS treatment.},

title = {Synaptic bombardment modulates muscarinic effects in forelimb motor cortex},
abstract = {Neocortical neurons in vivo exist in an environment of continuous synaptic bombardment, receiving a complex barrage of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. This background activity (by depolarizing neurons, increasing membrane conductance, and introducing fluctuations) strongly alters many aspects of neuronal responsiveness. In this study, we asked how it shapes neuromodulation of postsynaptic responses. Specifically, we examined muscarinic modulation of forelimb motor cortex, a brain area in which cholinergic stimulation is known to be necessary for modifications during motor skill learning. Using a dynamic clamp system to inject simulated conductances into pyramidal neurons in motor cortical slices, we mimicked in vivo-like activity by introducing a random background of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. When muscarinic receptors were stimulated with the agonist oxotremorine-M, several previously described currents were modified, and excitability was increased. However, the presence of the background conductances strongly attenuated most muscarinic agonist effects, with the notable exception that sustained firing responses to trains of inputs were well preserved. This may be important for promoting plasticity in vivo.},

title = {A method to estimate synaptic conductances from membrane potential fluctuations},
abstract = {In neocortical neurons, network activity can activate a large number of synaptic inputs, resulting in highly irregular subthreshold membrane potential (V(m)) fluctuations, commonly called "synaptic noise." This activity contains information about the underlying network dynamics, but it is not easy to extract network properties from such complex and irregular activity. Here, we propose a method to estimate properties of network activity from intracellular recordings and test this method using theoretical and experimental approaches. The method is based on the analytic expression of the subthreshold V(m) distribution at steady state in conductance-based models. Fitting this analytic expression to V(m) distributions obtained from intracellular recordings provides estimates of the mean and variance of excitatory and inhibitory conductances. We test the accuracy of these estimates against computational models of increasing complexity. We also test the method using dynamic-clamp recordings of neocortical neurons in vitro. By using an on-line analysis procedure, we show that the measured conductances from spontaneous network activity can be used to re-create artificial states equivalent to real network activity. This approach should be applicable to intracellular recordings during different network states in vivo, providing a characterization of the global properties of synaptic conductances and possible insight into the underlying network mechanisms.},

title = {Parameter estimation for bursting neural models},
abstract = {This paper presents work on parameter estimation methods for bursting neural models. In our approach we use both geometrical features specific to bursting, as well as general features such as periodic orbits and their bifurcations. We use the geometry underlying bursting to introduce defining equations for burst initiation and termination, and restrict the estimation algorithms to the space of bursting periodic orbits when trying to fit periodic burst data. These geometrical ideas are combined with automatic differentiation to accurately compute parameter sensitivities for the burst timing and period. In addition to being of inherent interest, these sensitivities are used in standard gradient-based optimization algorithms to fit model burst duration and period to data. As an application, we fit Butera et al.'s (Journal of Neurophysiology 81, 382-397, 1999) model of preB{\"o}tzinger complex neurons to empirical data both in control conditions and when the neuromodulator norepinephrine is added (Viemari and Ramirez, Journal of Neurophysiology 95, 2070-2082, 2006). The results suggest possible modulatory mechanisms in the preB{\"o}tzinger complex, including modulation of the persistent sodium current.},

abstract = {Many cerebellar neurons fire spontaneously, generating 10-100 action potentials per second even without synaptic input. This high basal activity correlates with information-coding mechanisms that differ from those of cells that are quiescent until excited synaptically. For example, in the deep cerebellar nuclei, Hebbian patterns of coincident synaptic excitation and postsynaptic firing fail to induce long-term increases in the strength of excitatory inputs. Instead, excitatory synaptic currents are potentiated by combinations of inhibition and excitation that resemble the activity of Purkinje and mossy fiber afferents that is predicted to occur during cerebellar associative learning tasks. Such results indicate that circuits with intrinsically active neurons have rules for information transfer and storage that distinguish them from other brain regions.},

title = {The use of automated parameter searches to improve ion channel kinetics for neural modeling},
abstract = {The voltage and time dependence of ion channels can be regulated, notably by phosphorylation, interaction with phospholipids, and binding to auxiliary subunits. Many parameter variation studies have set conductance densities free while leaving kinetic channel properties fixed as the experimental constraints on the latter are usually better than on the former. Because individual cells can tightly regulate their ion channel properties, we suggest that kinetic parameters may be profitably set free during model optimization in order to both improve matches to data and refine kinetic parameters. To this end, we analyzed the parameter optimization of reduced models of three electrophysiologically characterized and morphologically reconstructed globus pallidus neurons. We performed two automated searches with different types of free parameters. First, conductance density parameters were set free. Even the best resulting models exhibited unavoidable problems which were due to limitations in our channel kinetics. We next set channel kinetics free for the optimized density matches and obtained significantly improved model performance. Some kinetic parameters consistently shifted to similar new values in multiple runs across three models, suggesting the possibility for tailored improvements to channel models. These results suggest that optimized channel kinetics can improve model matches to experimental voltage traces, particularly for channels characterized under different experimental conditions than recorded data to be matched by a model. The resulting shifts in channel kinetics from the original template provide valuable guidance for future experimental efforts to determine the detailed kinetics of channel isoforms and possible modulated states in particular types of neurons.},

title = {Multiscale recursive estimation, data fusion, and regularization},
abstract = {We describe a framework for modeling stochastic phenomena at multiple scales and for their efficient estimation or reconstruction given partial and/or noisy measurements which may also be at several scales. In particular multiscale signal representations lead naturally to pyramidal or tree-like data structures in which each level in the tree corresponds to a particular scale of representation. A class of multiscale dynamic models evolving on dyadic trees is introduced. The main focus of this paper is on the description, analysis, and application of an extremely efficient optimal estimation algorithm for this class of models. This algorithm consists of a fine-to-coarse filtering sweep, followed by a coarse-to-fine smoothing step, corresponding to the dyadic tree generalization of Kalman filtering and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoothing. The Kalman filtering sweep consists of the recursive application of three steps: a measurement update step, a fine-to-coarse prediction step, and a fusion step. We illustrate the use of our methodology for the fusion of multiresolution data and for the efficient solution of ``fractal regularizations'' of ill-posed signal and image processing problems encountered},

abstract = {Networks of GABAergic neurons are key elements in the generation of gamma oscillations in the brain. Computational studies suggested that the emergence of coherent oscillations requires hyperpolarizing inhibition. Here, we show that GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition in mature interneurons of the hippocampal dentate gyrus is shunting rather than hyperpolarizing. Unexpectedly, when shunting inhibition is incorporated into a structured interneuron network model with fast and strong synapses, coherent oscillations emerge. In comparison to hyperpolarizing inhibition, networks with shunting inhibition show several advantages. First, oscillations are generated with smaller tonic excitatory drive. Second, network frequencies are tuned to the gamma band. Finally, robustness against heterogeneity in the excitatory drive is markedly improved. In single interneurons, shunting inhibition shortens the interspike interval for low levels of drive but prolongs it for high levels, leading to homogenization of neuronal firing rates. Thus, shunting inhibition may confer increased robustness to gamma oscillations in the brain.},

During entrainment the Shannon entropy of the output spike times was reduced sharply compared with its value outside entrainment. Surprisingly, however. the information transfer as measured by the mutual information between the number of inhibitory inputs in a cycle and the phase lag of the subsequent output spike was significantly increased during entrainment. This increase was due to the reduced contribution of the internal correlations to the output variability.

abstract = {To understand functions of a single neuron, such as propagation and generation of synaptic or action potentials, a detailed description of the kinetics and distribution of the underlying ionic conductances is essential. In voltage-clamp experiments, incomplete space clamp distorts the recorded currents, rendering accurate analysis impossible. Here, we present a simple numerical algorithm that corrects such distortions. The method performs a stepwise approximation of the conductance density at the site of a local voltage clamp. This is achieved by estimating membrane conductances in a simulation that yields simulated clamp currents, which are then fitted to the distorted recordings from the non-space-clamped structure, relying on accurately reconstructed cell morphology and experimentally determined passive properties. The method enabled accurate retrieval of the local densities, kinetics, and density gradients of somatic and dendritic channels. Neither the addition of noise nor variation of passive parameters significantly reduced the performance of the correction algorithm. The correction method was applied to two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings of K(+) currents from the apical dendrite of layer 5 neocortical pyramidal neurons. The generality and robustness of the algorithm make it a useful tool for voltage-clamp analysis of voltage-gated currents in structures of any morphology that is amenable to the voltage-clamp technique.},

title = {Ionic factors governing rebound burst phenotype in rat deep cerebellar neurons},
abstract = {Large diameter cells in rat deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) can be distinguished according to the generation of a transient or weak rebound burst and the expression of T-type Ca(2+) channel isoforms. We studied the ionic basis for the distinction in burst phenotypes in rat DCN cells in vitro. Following a hyperpolarization, transient burst cells generated a high-frequency spike burst of < or = 450 Hz, whereas weak burst cells generated a lower-frequency increase (<140 Hz). Both cell types expressed a low voltage-activated (LVA) Ca(2+) current near threshold for rebound burst discharge (-50 mV) that was consistent with T-type Ca(2+) current, but on average 7 times more current was recorded in transient burst cells. The number and frequency of spikes in rebound bursts was tightly correlated with the peak Ca(2+) current at -50 mV, showing a direct relationship between the availability of LVA Ca(2+) current and spike output. Transient burst cells exhibited a larger spike depolarizing afterpotential that was insensitive to blockers of voltage-gated Na(+) or Ca(2+) channels. In comparison, weak burst cells exhibited larger afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) that reduced cell excitability and rebound spike output. The sensitivity of AHPs to Ca(2+) channel blockers suggests that both LVA and high voltage-activated (HVA) Ca(2+) channels trigger AHPs in weak burst compared with only HVA Ca(2+) channels in transient burst cells. The two burst phenotypes in rat DCN cells thus derive in part from a difference in the availability of LVA Ca(2+) current following a hyperpolarization and a differential activation of AHPs that establish distinct levels of membrane excitability.},

abstract = {The dynamic-clamp method provides a powerful electrophysiological tool for creating virtual ionic conductances in living cells and studying their influence on membrane potential. Here we describe G-clamp, a new way to implement a dynamic clamp using the real-time version of the Lab-VIEW programming environment together with a Windows host, an embedded microprocessor that runs a real-time operating system and a multifunction data-acquisition board. The software includes descriptions of a fast voltage-dependent sodium conductance, delayed rectifier, M-type and A-type potassium conductances, and a leak conductance. The system can also read synaptic conductance waveforms from preassembled data files. These virtual conductances can be reliably implemented at speeds < or =43 kHz while simultaneously saving two channels of data with 16-bit precision. G-clamp also includes utilities for measuring current-voltage relations, synaptic strength, and synaptic gain. Taking an approach built on a commercially available software/hardware platform has resulted in a system that is easy to assemble and upgrade. In addition, the graphical programming structure of LabVIEW should make it relatively easy for others to adapt G-clamp for new experimental applications.},

title = {Long-QT syndrome-related sodium channel mutations probed by the dynamic action potential clamp technique},
abstract = {Long-QT3 syndrome (LQT3) is linked to cardiac sodium channel gene (SCN5A) mutations. In this study, we used the 'dynamic action potential clamp' (dAPC) technique to effectively replace the native sodium current (I(Na)) of the Priebe-Beuckelmann human ventricular cell model with wild-type (WT) or mutant I(Na) generated in a human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cell that is voltage clamped by the free-running action potential of the ventricular cell. We recorded I(Na) from HEK cells expressing either WT or LQT3-associated Y1795C or A1330P SCN5A at 35 degrees C, and let this current generate and shape the action potential (AP) of subepicardial, mid-myocardial and subendocardial model cells. The HEK cell's endogenous background current was completely removed by a real-time digital subtraction procedure. With WT I(Na), AP duration (APD) was longer than with the original Priebe-Beuckelmann model I(Na), due to a late I(Na) component of approximately 30 pA that could not be revealed with conventional voltage-clamp protocols. With mutant I(Na), this late component was larger ( approximately 100 pA), producing a marked increase in APD ( approximately 70-80 ms at 1 Hz for the subepicardial model cell). The late I(Na) magnitude showed reverse frequency dependence, resulting in a significantly steeper APD-frequency relation in the mutant case. AP prolongation was more pronounced for the mid-myocardial cell type, resulting in increased APD dispersion for each of the mutants. For both mutants, a 2 s pause following rapid (2 Hz) pacing resulted in distorted AP morphology and beat-to-beat fluctuations of I(Na). Our dAPC data directly demonstrate the arrhythmogenic nature of LQT3-associated SCN5A mutations.},

We here adapt the nonlinear method of unscented Kalman filtering to observe the state and estimate parameters in a computational spatiotemporal excitable system that serves as a model for cerebral cortex. We demonstrate the ability to track spiral wave dynamics, and to use an observer system to calculate control signals delivered through applied electrical fields. We demonstrate how this strategy can control the frequency of such a system, or quench the wave patterns, while minimizing the energy required for such results. These findings are readily testable in experimental applications, and have the potential to be applied to the treatment of human disease.},

abstract = {Sensory relay structures in the spinal cord dorsal horn are now thought to be active processing structures that function before supraspinal sensory integration. Dorsal horn neurons directly receive nociceptive (pain) signals from the periphery, express a high degree of functional plasticity and are involved in long-term sensitization and chronic pain. We show here that deep dorsal horn neurons (DHNs) in Wistar rats can switch their intrinsic firing properties from tonic to plateau or endogenous bursting patterns, depending upon the balance of control by metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) and GABA(B) receptors. We further show that this modulation acts on at least one common target, the inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir3). Finally, we found that these firing modes correspond to specific functional states of information transfer in which dorsal horn neurons can faithfully transmit, greatly enhance or block the transfer of nociceptive information.},

abstract = {In previous studies we used the technique of dynamic clamp to study how temporal modulation of inhibitory and excitatory inputs control the frequency and precise timing of spikes in neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). While this technique is now widely used, it is limited to interpreting conductance inputs as being location independent, i.e. all inputs that are biologically distributed across the dendritic tree are applied to the soma. We used computer simulations of a morphologically realistic model of DCN neurons to compare the effects of purely somatic versus distributed dendritic inputs in this cell type. We applied the same conductance stimuli used in our published experiments to the model. To simulate variability in neuronal responses to repeated stimuli, we added a somatic white current noise to reproduce subthreshold fluctuations in the membrane potential. We were able to replicate our dynamic clamp results with respect to spike rates and spike precision for different patterns of background synaptic activity. We found only minor differences in the spike pattern generation between focal or distributed input in this cell type even when strong inhibitory or excitatory bursts were applied. However, the location dependence of dynamic clamp stimuli is likely to be different for each cell type examined, and the simulation approach developed here will allow a careful assessment of location dependence in all cell types.},

title = {Characterizing neuronal activity by describing the membrane potential as a stochastic process},
abstract = {Cortical neurons behave similarly to stochastic processes, as a consequence of their irregularity and dense connectivity. Their firing pattern is close to a Poisson process, and their membrane potential (V(m)) is analogous to colored noise. One way to characterize this activity is to identify V(m) to a multidimensional stochastic process. We review here this approach and how it can be used to extract important statistical signatures of neuronal activity. The "VmD method" consists of fitting the V(m) distribution obtained intracellularly to analytic expressions derived from stochastic processes, and thereby deduce synaptic conductance parameters. However, this method requires at least two levels of V(m), which prevents applications to single-trial measurements. We also discuss methods that can be applied to single V(m) traces, such as power spectral analysis and the "STA method" to calculate spike-triggered average conductances based on a maximum likelihood procedure. A recently proposed method, the "VmT method", is based on the fusion of these two concepts. This method is analogous to the VmD method and estimates the mean excitatory and inhibitory conductances and their variances. However, it does so by using a maximum-likelihood estimation, and can thus be applied to single V(m) traces. All methods were tested using controlled conductance injection in dynamic-clamp experiments.},

title = {The Mechanism of Abrupt Transition between Theta and Hyper-Excitable Spiking Activity in Medial Entorhinal Cortex Layer II Stellate Cells},
abstract = {Recent studies have shown that stellate cells (SCs) of the medial entorhinal cortex become hyper-excitable in animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy. These studies have also demonstrated the existence of recurrent connections among SCs, reduced levels of recurrent inhibition in epileptic networks as compared to control ones, and comparable levels of recurrent excitation among SCs in both network types. In this work, we investigate the biophysical and dynamic mechanism of generation of the fast time scale corresponding to hyper-excitable firing and the transition between theta and fast firing frequency activity in SCs. We show that recurrently connected minimal networks of SCs exhibit abrupt, threshold-like transition between theta and hyper-excitable firing frequencies as the result of small changes in the maximal synaptic (AMPAergic) conductance. The threshold required for this transition is modulated by synaptic inhibition. Similar abrupt transition between firing frequency regimes can be observed in single, self-coupled SCs, which represent a network of recurrently coupled neurons synchronized in phase, but not in synaptically isolated SCs as the result of changes in the levels of the tonic drive. Using dynamical systems tools (phase-space analysis), we explain the dynamic mechanism underlying the genesis of the fast time scale and the abrupt transition between firing frequency regimes, their dependence on the intrinsic SC's currents and synaptic excitation. This abrupt transition is mechanistically different from others observed in similar networks with different cell types. Most notably, there is no bistability involved. 'In vitro' experiments using single SCs self-coupled with dynamic clamp show the abrupt transition between firing frequency regimes, and demonstrate that our theoretical predictions are not an artifact of the model. In addition, these experiments show that high-frequency firing is burst-like with a duration modulated by an M-current.},

title = {In vivo dynamic clamp study of I(h) in the mouse inferior colliculus},
abstract = {Approximately half of the cells in the mouse inferior colliculus have the hyperpolarization-activated mixed cation current I(h), yet little is known about its functional relevance in vivo. We therefore studied its contribution to the processing of sound information in single cells by making in vivo whole cell recordings from the inferior colliculus (IC) of young-adult anesthetized C57Bl/6 mice. Following pharmacological block of the endogenous channels, a dynamic clamp approach allowed us to study the responses to current injections or auditory stimuli in the presence and absence of I(h) within the same neuron, thus avoiding network or developmental effects. The presence of I(h) changed basic cellular properties, including depolarizing the resting membrane potential and decreasing resting membrane resistance. Sound-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials were smaller but at the same time reached a more positive membrane potential when I(h) was present. With I(h), a subset of cells showed rebound spiking following hyperpolarizing current injection. Its presence also changed more complex cellular properties. It decreased temporal summation in response to both hyperpolarizing and depolarizing repetitive current stimuli, and resulted in small changes in the cycle-averaged membrane potential during sinusoidal amplitude modulated (SAM) tones. Furthermore, I(h) minimally decreased the response to a tone following a depolarization, an effect that may make a small contribution to forward masking. Our results thus suggest that previously observed differences in IC cells are a mixture of direct effects of I(h) and indirect effects due to the change in membrane potential or effects due to the co-expression with other channels.},

title = {Delayed rectifier currents in rat globus pallidus neurons are attributable to Kv2.1 and Kv3.1/3.2 K+ channels},
abstract = {The symptoms of Parkinson disease are thought to result in part from increased burst activity in globus pallidus neurons. To gain a better understanding of the factors governing this activity, we studied delayed rectifier K+ conductances in acutely isolated rat globus pallidus (GP) neurons, using whole-cell voltage-clamp and single-cell RT-PCR techniques. From a holding potential of -40 mV, depolarizing voltage steps in identified GP neurons evoked slowly inactivating K+ currents. Analysis of the tail currents revealed rapidly and slowly deactivating currents of similar amplitude, The fast component of the current deactivated with a time constant of 11.1 +/- 0.8 msec at -40 mV and was blacked by micromolar concentrations of 4-AP and TEA (K-D similar to 140 mu M). The slow component of the current deactivated with a time constant of 89 +/- 10 msec at -40 mV and was less sensitive to TEA (K-D = 0.8 mM) and 4-AP (K-D similar to 6 mM). Organic antagonists of Kv1 family channels had little or no effect on somatic currents. These properties are consistent with the hypothesis that the rapidly deactivating current is attributable to Kv3.1/3.2 channels and the slowly deactivating current to Kv2.1-containing channels. Semiquantitative single-cell RT-PCR analysis of Kv3 and Kv2 family mRNAs supported this conclusion. An alteration in the balance of these two channel types could underlie the emergence of burst firing after dopamine-depleting lesions.},

title = {A fast-conducting, stochastic integrative mode for neocortical neurons in vivo},
abstract = {During activated states, neocortical neurons receive intense synaptic background activity that induces large-amplitude membrane potential fluctuations and a strong conductance in the membrane. However, little is known about the integrative properties of neurons during such high-conductance states. Here we investigated the integrative properties of neocortical pyramidal neurons under in vivo conditions simulated by computational models. We show that the presence of high-conductance fluctuations induces a stochastic state in which active dendrites are fast conducting and have a different dynamics of initiation and forward-propagation of Na+-dependent spikes. Synaptic efficacy, quantified as the probability that a synaptic input specifically evokes a somatic spike, was approximately independent of the dendritic location of the synapse. Synaptic inputs evoked precisely timed responses (milliseconds), which also showed a reduced location dependence. This scheme was found to apply to a broad range of kinetics and density distributions of voltage-dependent conductances, as well as to different dendritic morphologies. Synaptic efficacies were, however, modulable by the balance of excitation and inhibition in background activity, for all synapses at once. Thus, models predict that the intense synaptic activity in vivo can confer advantageous computational properties to neocortical neurons: they can be set to an integrative mode that is stochastic, fast conducting, and optimized to process synaptic inputs at high temporal resolution independently of their position in the dendrites. Some of these predictions can be tested experimentally.},

title = {Dopamine neuron responses depend exponentially on pacemaker interval},
abstract = {Midbrain dopamine neuron activity results from the integration of the responses to metabo- and ionotropic receptors with the postsynaptic excitability of these intrinsic pacemakers. Interestingly, intrinsic pacemaker rate varies greatly between individual dopamine neurons and is subject to short- and long-term regulation. Here responses of substantia nigra dopamine neurons to defined dynamic-clamp stimuli were measured to quantify the impact of cell-to-cell variation in intrinsic pacemaker rate. Then this approach was repeated in single dopamine neurons in which pacemaker rate was altered by activation of muscarinic receptors or current injection. These experiments revealed a dramatic exponential dependence on pacemaker interval for the responses to voltage-gated A-type K+ channels, voltage-independent cation channels and ionotropic synapses. Likewise, responses to native metabotropic (GABAb and mGluR1) inhibitory synapses depended steeply on pacemaker interval. These results show that observed variations in dopamine neuron pacemaker rate are functionally significant because they produce a >10-fold difference in responses to diverse stimuli. Both the magnitude and the mathematical form of the relationship between pacemaker interval and responses were not previously anticipated.},

abstract = {Parameters for models of biological systems are often obtained by averaging over experimental results from a number of different preparations. To explore the validity of this procedure, we studied the behavior of a conductance-based model neuron with five voltage-dependent conductances. We randomly varied the maximal conductance of each of the active currents in the model and identified sets of maximal conductances that generate bursting neurons that fire a single action potential at the peak of a slow membrane potential depolarization. A model constructed using the means of the maximal conductances of this population is not itself a one-spike burster, but rather fires three action potentials per burst. Averaging fails because the maximal conductances of the population of one-spike bursters lie in a highly concave region of parameter space that does not contain its mean. This demonstrates that averages over multiple samples can fail to characterize a system whose behavior depends on interactions involving a number of highly variable components.},

title = {Ca(v)1.3 and BK channels for timing and regulating cell firing},
abstract = {L-type Ca(2+) channels (LTCCs, Ca(v)1) open readily during membrane depolarization and allow Ca(2+) to enter the cell. In this way, LTCCs regulate cell excitability and trigger a variety of Ca(2+)-dependent physiological processes such as: excitation-contraction coupling in muscle cells, gene expression, synaptic plasticity, neuronal differentiation, hormone secretion, and pacemaker activity in heart, neurons, and endocrine cells. Among the two major isoforms of LTCCs expressed in excitable tissues (Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3), Ca(v)1.3 appears suitable for supporting a pacemaker current in spontaneously firing cells. It has steep voltage dependence and low threshold of activation and inactivates slowly. Using Ca(v)1.3(-/-) KO mice and membrane current recording techniques such as the dynamic and the action potential clamp, it has been possible to resolve the time course of Ca(v)1.3 pacemaker currents that regulate the spontaneous firing of dopaminergic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells. In several cell types, Ca(v)1.3 is selectively coupled to BK channels within membrane nanodomains and controls both the firing frequency and the action potential repolarization phase. Here we review the most critical aspects of Ca(v)1.3 channel gating and its coupling to large conductance BK channels recently discovered in spontaneously firing neurons and neuroendocrine cells with the aim of furnishing a converging view of the role that these two channel types play in the regulation of cell excitability.},

Exploring interactions between small numbers of synaptically coupled neurons in vitro can provide insight into the in vivo activity of neuronal assemblies. However, pairs of synaptically coupled neurons are notoriously difficult to find in vitro, and trying to study networks of more than two neurons is nearly impossible. The advent of the dynamic-clamp technique enables researchers to generate hybrid networks of neurons in which living neurons are synaptically coupled through computationally generated synapses. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the components of a dynamic-clamp system. We detail how to use dynamic clamp to construct simple neuronal networks from living neurons as well as hybrid networks including both living and in silico neurons.},

title = {Towards model-based control of Parkinson's disease},
abstract = {Modern model-based control theory has led to transformative improvements in our ability to track the nonlinear dynamics of systems that we observe, and to engineer control systems of unprecedented efficacy. In parallel with these developments, our ability to build computational models to embody our expanding knowledge of the biophysics of neurons and their networks is maturing at a rapid rate. In the treatment of human dynamical disease, our employment of deep brain stimulators for the treatment of Parkinson's disease is gaining increasing acceptance. Thus, the confluence of these three developments--control theory, computational neuroscience and deep brain stimulation--offers a unique opportunity to create novel approaches to the treatment of this disease. This paper explores the relevant state of the art of science, medicine and engineering, and proposes a strategy for model-based control of Parkinson's disease. We present a set of preliminary calculations employing basal ganglia computational models, structured within an unscented Kalman filter for tracking observations and prescribing control. Based upon these findings, we will offer suggestions for future research and development.},

title = {Well-timed, brief inhibition can promote spiking: Postinhibitory facilitation},
abstract = {Brief synaptic inhibition can overwhelm a nearly coincident suprathreshold excitatory input to preclude spike generation. Surprisingly, a brief inhibitory event that occurs in a favorable time window preceding an otherwise subthreshold excitation can facilitate spiking. Such postinhibitory facilitation (PIF) requires that the inhibition has a short (decay) time constant tau(inh). The timescale ranges of tau(inh) and of the window (width and timing) for PIF depend on the rates of neuronal subthreshold dynamics. The mechanism for PIF is general, involving reduction by hyperpolarization of some excitability-suppressing factor that is partially recruited at rest. Here we illustrate and analyze PIF, experimentally and theoretically, using brain stem auditory neurons and a conductance-based five-variable model. In this auditory case, PIF timescales are in the sub- to few millisecond range and the primary mechanistic factor is a low-threshold potassium conductance g(KLT). Competing dynamic influences create the favorable time window: hyperpolarization that moves V away from threshold and hyperexcitability resulting from reduced g(KLT). A two-variable reduced model that retains the dynamics only of V and g(KLT) displays a similar time window. We analyze this model in the phase plane; its geometry has generic features. Further generalizing, we show that PIF behavior may occur even in a very reduced model with linear subthreshold dynamics, by using an integrate-and-fire model with an accommodating voltage-dependent threshold. Our analyses of PIF provide insights for fast inhibition's facilitatory effects in longer trains. Periodic subthreshold excitatory inputs can lead to firing, even one for one, if brief inhibitory inputs are interleaved within a range of favorable phase lags. The temporal specificity of inhibition's facilitating effect could play a role in temporal processing, in sensitivity to inhibitory and excitatory temporal patterning, in the auditory and other neural systems.},

Typically, this involves a sequence of multiple biophysical processes that cannot all be monitored directly. In this work, we present an approach that is based on analyzing different stimuli that cause the same final output, here defined as the probability of the receptor neuron to fire a single action potential. Comparing such iso-response stimuli within the framework of nonlinear cascade models allows us to extract the characteristics of individual signal-processing steps with a temporal resolution much finer than the trial-to-trial variability of the measured output spike times. Applied to insect auditory receptor cells, the technique reveals the sub-millisecond dynamics of the eardrum vibration and of the electrical potential and yields a quantitative four-step cascade model. The model accounts for the tuning properties of this class of neurons and explains their high temporal resolution under natural stimulation. Owing to its simplicity and generality, the presented method is readily applicable to other nonlinear cascades and a large variety of signal-processing systems.},

title = {Modulation of dendritic synaptic processing in the lateral superior olive by hyperpolarization-activated currents},
abstract = {We have previously shown that mice lateral superior olive (LSO) neurons exhibit a large hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h) ), and that hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated type 1 channels are present in both the soma and dendrites of these cells. Here we show that the dendritic I(h) in LSO neurons modulates the integration of multiple synaptic inputs. We tested the LSO neuron's ability to integrate synaptic inputs by evoking excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) in conjunction with brief depolarizing current pulses (to simulate a second excitatory input) at different time delays. We compared LSO neurons with the native I(h) present in both the soma and dendrites (control) with LSO neurons without I(h) (blocked with ZD7288) and with LSO neurons with I(h) only present peri-somatically (ZD7288+ computer-simulated I(h) using a dynamic clamp). LSO neurons without I(h) had a wider time window for firing in response to inputs with short time separations. Simulated somatic I(h) (dynamic clamp) could not reverse this effect. Blocking I(h) also increased the summation of EPSPs elicited at both proximal and distal dendritic regions, and dramatically altered the integration of EPSPs and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials. The addition of simulated peri-somatic I(h) could not abolish a ZD7288-induced increase of responsiveness to widely separated excitatory inputs. Using a compartmental LSO model, we show that dendritic I(h) can reduce EPSP integration by locally decreasing the input resistance. Our results suggest a significant role for dendritic I(h) in LSO neurons, where the activation/deactivation of I(h) can alter the LSO response to synaptic inputs.},

title = {Some insights into computational models of (patho)physiological brain activity},
abstract = {The amount of experimental data concerning physiology and anatomy of the nervous system is growing very fast, challenging our capacity to make comprehensive syntheses of the plethora of data available. Computer models of neuronal networks provide useful tools to construct such syntheses. They can be used to interpret experimental data, generate experimentally testable predictions, and formulate new hypotheses regarding the function of the neural systems. Models can also act as a bridge between different levels of neuronal organization. The ultimate aim of computational neuroscience is to provide a link between behavior and underlying neural mechanisms. Depending on the specific aim of the model, there are different levels of neuronal organization at which the model can be set. Models are constructed at the microscopic (molecular and cellular), macroscopic level (local populations or systems), or dynamical systems level. Apart from purely computational models, hybrid networks are being developed in which biological neurons are connected in vitro to computer simulated neurons. Also, neuromorphic systems are recently being created using silicon chips that mimic computational operations in the brain. This paper reviews various computational models of the brain and insights obtained through their simulations.},

abstract = {The cells of the inferior olivary nucleus, the sole source of the cerebellar climbing fibers, form a network of electrically coupled neurons. Experimental observations show that these neurons produce a large repertoire of electrical signals, among which sub-threshold oscillations of the membrane potential. Simultaneous recordings from pairs of neurons and optical imaging of voltage sensitive dyes show that sub-threshold activity occurs in synchrony throughout the network The mechanism underlying the generation of the sub-threshold oscillations is not fully understood. Experimental observations suggest that the electrical coupling is essential but insufficient for their generation. Several theoretical mechanisms have been suggested to explain these observations. Up-to-date, the most realistic model is the heterogeneity model, that assumes a certain degree of heterogeneity among olivary neurons. The heterogeneity model proposes that sub-threshold oscillations are produced by electrical coupling of neurons with the same types of ionic conductances, but with different densities. The variability in channel densities yield neurons of different functional types. The main prediction of the model is that different functional types of neurons should be found in the inferior olive. Dynamic clamp experiments support this prediction. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. Published by Editions scientifiques el medicales Elsevier SAS.},

title = {Morphological and Electrophysiological Properties of GABAergic and Non-GABAergic Cells in the Deep Cerebellar Nuclei},
abstract = {The deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) integrate inputs from the brain stem, the inferior olive, and the spinal cord with Purkinje cell output from cerebellar cortex and provide the major output of the cerebellum. Despite their crucial function in motor control and learning, the various populations of neurons in the DCN are poorly defined and characterized. Importantly, differences in electrophysiological properties between glutamatergic and GABAergic cells of the DCN have been largely elusive. Here, we used glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 67-green fluorescent protein (GFP) knock-in mice to unambiguously identify GABAergic (GAD-positive) and non-GABAergic (GAD-negative, most likely glutamatergic) neurons of the DCN. Morphological analysis of DCN neurons patch-clamped with biocytin-containing electrodes revealed a significant overlap in the distributions of the soma sizes of GAD-positive and GAD-negative cells. Compared with GAD-negative DCN neurons, GAD-positive DCN neurons fire broader action potentials, display stronger frequency accommodation, and do not reach as high firing frequencies during depolarizing current injections. Furthermore, GAD-positive cells display slower spontaneous firing rates and have a more shallow frequency-to-current relationship than the GAD-negative cells but exhibit a longer-lasting rebound depolarization and associated spiking after a transient hyperpolarization. In contrast to the rather homogeneous population of GAD-positive cells, the GAD-negative cells were found to consist of two distinct populations as defined by cell size and electrophysiological features. We conclude that GABAergic DCN neurons are specialized to convey phasic spike rate information, whereas tonic spike rate is more faithfully relayed by the large non-GABAergic cells.},

abstract = {The notion that a computer can decode brain signals to infer the intentions of a human and then enact those intentions directly through a machine is becoming a realistic technical possibility. These types of devices are known as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The evolution of these neuroprosthetic technologies could have significant implications for patients with motor disabilities by enhancing their ability to interact and communicate with their environment. The cortical physiology most investigated and used for device control has been brain signals from the primary motor cortex. To date, this classic motor physiology has been an effective substrate for demonstrating the potential efficacy of BCI-based control. However, emerging research now stands to further enhance our understanding of the cortical physiology underpinning human intent and provide further signals for more complex brain-derived control. In this review, the authors report the current status of BCIs and detail the emerging research trends that stand to augment clinical applications in the future.},

title = {Integration of K+ and Cl- currents regulate steady-state and dynamic membrane potentials in cultured rat microglia},
abstract = {The role of ion channels and membrane potential (V(m)) in non-excitable cells has recently come under increased scrutiny. Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, express voltage-gated Kv1.3 channels, a Kir2.1-like inward rectifier, a swelling-activated Cl(-) current and several other channels. We previously showed that Kv1.3 and Cl(-) currents are needed for microglial cell proliferation and that Kv1.3 is important for the respiratory burst. Although their mechanisms of action are unknown, one general role for these channels is to maintain a negative V(m). An impediment to measuring V(m) in non-excitable cells is that many have a very high electrical resistance, which makes them extremely susceptible to leak-induced depolarization. Using non-invasive V(m)-sensitive dyes, we show for the first time that the membrane resistance of microglial cells is several gigaohms; much higher than the seal resistance during patch-clamp recordings. Surprisingly, we observed that small current injections can evoke large V(m) oscillations in some microglial cells, and that injection of sinusoidal currents of varying frequency exposes a strong intrinsic electrical resonance in the 5- to 20-Hz frequency range in all microglial cells tested. Using a dynamic current clamp that we developed to actively compensate for the damage done by the patch-clamp electrode, we found that the V(m) oscillations and resonance were more prevalent and larger. Both types of electrical behaviour required Kv1.3 channels, as they were eliminated by the Kv1.3 blocker, agitoxin-2. To further determine how the ion currents integrate in these cells, voltage-clamp recordings from microglial cells displaying these behaviours were used to analyse the biophysical properties of the Kv1.3, Kir and Cl(-) currents. A mathematical model that incorporated only these three currents reproduced the observed V(m) oscillations and electrical resonance. Thus, the electrical behaviour of this 'non-excitable' cell type is much more complex than previously suspected, and might reflect a more common oversight in high resistance cells.},

title = {Gain control of firing rate by shunting inhibition: roles of synaptic noise and dendritic saturation},
abstract = {Adjusting input-output gain is crucial for information processing by the brain. Gain control of subthreshold depolarization is commonly ascribed to increased membrane conductance caused by shunting inhibition. But contrary to its divisive effect on depolarization, shunting inhibition on its own fails to divisively modulate firing rate, apparently upsetting a critical tenet of neural models that use shunting inhibition to achieve gain control. Using a biophysically realistic neuron model, we show that divisive modulation of firing rate by shunting inhibition requires synaptic noise to smooth the relation between firing rate and somatic depolarization; although necessary, noise alone endows shunting inhibition with only a modest divisive effect on firing rate. In addition to introducing noise, synaptic input is associated with a nonlinear relation between somatic depolarization and excitation because of dendritic saturation; this nonlinearity dramatically enhances divisive modulation of firing rate by shunting inhibition under noisy conditions. Thus, shunting inhibition can act as a mechanism for firing rate gain control, but its modulatory effects (which include both divisive and subtractive components) are fully explained only when both synaptic noise and dendritic saturation are taken into account.},

title = {Sodium currents in vagotomized primary afferent neurones of the rat},
abstract = {1. Nodose ganglion neurones (NGNs) become less excitable following section of the vagus; nerve. To determine the role of sodium currents (I-Na) in these changes, standard patch-clamp recording techniques were used to measure I-Na in rat NGNs maintained in vivo for 5-6 days following vagotomy, and then in vitro for 2-9 h. 2. Total I-Na and I-Na density in vagotomized NGNs were similar to control values. However, steady-state I-Na inactivation in vagotomized NGNs was shifted -9 mV relative to control values (V-u2, -74 +/- 2 vs. -65 +/- 2 mV, P < 0.01) and I-Na activation was shifted by -7 mV (V, -21 +/- 2 vs. -14 +/- 2 mV, P < 0.006). recovery from inactivation was also slower in vagotomized NGNs (fast time constant, 2.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.3 ms, P < 0.02). 3. The fraction of I-Na resistant to 1 mum tetrodotoxin (TTX-R) was halved in vagotomized NGNs (21 +/- 8 vs. 56 +/- 8 % of total I-Na, P < 0.05). This change from TTX-R I-Na to TTX-sensitive (TTX-S) I-Na may explain altered I-Na activation, inactivation and repriming in vagotomized NGNs. 4. The contribution of alterations in I-Na to NGN firing patterns was assessed by measuring I-Na evoked by a series of action potential (AP) waveforms. In general, control NGNs produced large, repetitive TTX-R while vagotomized NGNs produced smaller TTX-S I-Na that rapidly inactivated during AP discharge. We conclude that TTX-R I-Na. is important for sustained AP discharge in NGNs, and that its diminution underlies the decreased AP discharge of vagotomized NGNs.},

abstract = {Interspecies differences can limit the translational value of excitable cells isolated from model organisms. It can be difficult to extrapolate from a drug- or mutation-induced phenotype in mice to human pathophysiology because mouse and human cardiac electrodynamics differ greatly. We present a hybrid computational-experimental technique, the cell-type transforming clamp, which is designed to overcome such differences by using a calculated compensatory current to convert the macroscopic electrical behavior of an isolated cell into that of a different cell type. We demonstrate the technique's utility by evaluating drug arrhythmogenicity in murine cardiomyocytes that are transformed to behave like human myocytes. Whereas we use the cell-type transforming clamp in this work to convert between mouse and human electrodynamics, the technique could be adapted to convert between the action potential morphologies of any two cell types of interest.},

title = {Inferring network activity from synaptic noise},
abstract = {During intense network activity in vivo, cortical neurons are in a high-conductance state, in which the membrane potential (V-m) is subject to a tremendous fluctuating activity. Clearly, this "synaptic noise" contains information about the activity of the network, but there are presently no methods available to extract this information. We focus here on this problem from a computational neuroscience perspective, with the aim of drawing methods to analyze experimental data. We start from models of cortical neurons, in which high-conductance states stein from the random release of thousands of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. This highly complex system can be simplified by using global synaptic conductances described by effective stochastic processes. The advantage of this approach is that one can derive analytically a number of properties from the statistics of resulting V-m fluctuations. For example, the global excitatory and inhibitory conductances can be extracted from synaptic noise, and can be related to the mean activity of presynaptic neurons. We show here that extracting the variances of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances can provide estimates of the mean temporal correlation-or level of synchrony-among thousands of neurons in the network. Thus, "probing the network" through intracellular V-m activity is possible and constitutes a promising approach, but it will require a continuous effort combining theory, computational models and intracellular physiology.

title = {Noise from voltage-gated ion channels may influence neuronal dynamics in the entorhinal cortex},
abstract = {Neurons of the superficial medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), which deliver neocortical input to the hippocampus, exhibit intrinsic, subthreshold oscillations with slow dynamics. These intrinsic oscillations, driven by a persistent Na+ current and a slow outward current, may help to generate the theta rhythm, a slow rhythm that plays an important role in spatial and declarative learning. Here we show that the number of persistent Na+ channels underlying subthreshold oscillations is relatively small (<10(4)) and use a physiologically based stochastic model to argue that the random behavior of these channels may contribute crucially to cellular-level responses. In acutely isolated MEC neurons under voltage clamp, the mean and variance of the persistent Na+ current were used to estimate the single channel conductance and voltage-dependent probability of opening. A hybrid stochastic-deterministic model was built by using voltage-clamp descriptions of the persistent and fast-inactivating Na+ conductances, along with the fast and slow K+ conductances. All voltage-dependent conductances were represented with nonlinear ordinary differential equations, with the exception of the persistent Na+ conductance, which was represented as a population of stochastic ion channels. The model predicts that the probabilistic nature of Na+ channels increases the cell's repertoire of qualitative behaviors; although deterministic models at a particular point in parameter space can generate either subthreshold oscillations or phase-locked spikes (but rarely both), models with an appropriate level of channel noise can replicate physiological behavior by generating both patterns of electrical activity for a single set of parameters. Channel noise may contribute to higher order interspike interval statistics seen in vitro with DC current stimulation. Models with channel noise show evidence of spike clustering seen in brain slice experiments, although the effect is apparently not as prominent as seen in experimental results. Channel noise may contribute to cellular responses in vivo as well; the stochastic system has enhanced sensitivity to small periodic stimuli in a form of stochastic resonance that is novel (in that the relevant noise source is intrinsic and voltage-dependent) and potentially physiologically relevant. Although based on a simple model that does not include all known membrane mechanisms of MEC stellate cells, these results nevertheless imply that the stochastic nature of small collections of molecules may have important effects at the cellular and network levels.},

abstract = {The well-known neural mass model described by Lopes da Silva et al. (1976) and Zetterberg et al. (1978) is fitted to actual EEG data. This is achieved by reformulating the original set of integral equations as a continuous-discrete state space model. The local linearization approach is then used to discretize the state equation and to construct a nonlinear Kalman filter. On this basis, a maximum likelihood procedure is used for estimating the model parameters for several EEG recordings. The analysis of the noise-free differential equations of the estimated models suggests that there are two different types of alpha rhythms: those with a point attractor and others with a limit cycle attractor. These attractors are also found by means of a nonlinear time series analysis of the EEG recordings. We conclude that the Hopf bifurcation described by Zetterberg et al. (1978) is present in actual brain dynamics.},

title = {Estimating receptive fields in the presence of spike-time jitter},
abstract = {Neurons in sensory systems are commonly characterized by their receptive fields. These are experimentally often obtained by reverse-correlation analyses, for example, by calculating the spike-triggered average. The reverse-correlation approach, however, generally assumes a fixed temporal relation between spike-generating stimulus features and measured spikes. Temporal jitter of spikes will therefore distort the estimated receptive fields. Here, a novel extension of widely used reverse-correlation techniques (spike-triggered average as well as spike-triggered covariance) is presented that allows accurate measurements of receptive fields even in the presence of considerable spike-time jitter. It is shown that the method correctly recovers the receptive fields from simulated spike trains. When applied to recordings from auditory receptor cells of locusts, a considerable sharpening of receptive fields as compared to standard spike-triggered averages is observed. In addition, the multiple filters that are obtained from a conventional spike-triggered covariance analysis of these data can be collapsed into a single component if spike jitter is accounted for. Finally, it is shown how further effects on spike timing, such as systematic shifts in spike latency, can be included in the approach.},

title = {Comment on "Characterization of subthreshold voltage fluctuations in neuronal membranes," by M. Rudolph and A. Destexhe},
abstract = {In two recent articles, Rudolph and Destexhe (2003, 2005) studied a leaky integrator model (an RC-circuit) driven by correlated ("colored") gaussian conductance noise and Gaussian current noise. In the first article, they derived an expression for the stationary probability density of the membrane voltage; in the second, they modified this expression to cover a larger parameter regime. Here we show by standard analysis of solvable limit cases (white noise limit of additive and multiplicative noise sources; only slow multiplicative noise; only additive noise) and by numerical simulations that their first result does not hold for the general colored-noise case and uncover the errors made in the derivation of a Fokker-Planck equation for the probability density. Furthermore, we demonstrate analytically (including an exact integral expression for the time-dependent mean value of the voltage) and by comparison to simulation results that the extended expression for the probability density works much better but still does not exactly solve the full colored-noise problem. We also show that at stronger synaptic input, the stationary mean value of the linear voltage model may diverge and give an exact condition relating the system parameters for which this takes place.},

Neurofitter is a software tool that interfaces existing neural simulation software and sophisticated optimization algorithms with a new way to compute the error measure. This error measure represents how well a given parameter set is able to reproduce the experimental data. It is based on the phase-plane trajectory density method, which is insensitive to small phase differences between model and data. Neurofitter enables the effortless combination of many different time-dependent data traces into the error measure, allowing the neuroscientist to focus on what are the seminal properties of the model.We show results obtained by applying Neurofitter to a simple single compartmental model and a complex multi-compartmental Purkinje cell (PC) model. These examples show that the method is able to solve a variety of tuning problems and demonstrate details of its practical application.},

abstract = {Neurons can make different responses to identical inputs. According to the emerging frequency of repetitive firing, neurons are classified into two types: type 1 and type 2 excitability. Though in mathematical simulations, minor modifications of parameters describing ionic currents can result in transitions between these two excitabilities, empirical evidence to support these theoretical possibilities is scarce. Here we report a joint theoretical and experimental study to test the hypothesis that changes in parameters describing ionic currents cause predictable transitions between the two excitabilities in mesencephalic V (Mes V) neurons. We developed a simple mathematical model of Mes V neurons. Using bifurcation analysis and model simulation, we then predicted that changes in conductance of two low-threshold currents would result in transitions between type 1 and type 2. Finally, by applying specific channel blockers, we observed the transition between two excitabilities forecast by the mathematical model.},

title = {Functional phase response curves: a method for understanding synchronization of adapting neurons},
abstract = {Phase response curves (PRCs) for a single neuron are often used to predict the synchrony of mutually coupled neurons. Previous theoretical work on pulse-coupled oscillators used single-pulse perturbations. We propose an alternate method in which functional PRCs (fPRCs) are generated using a train of pulses applied at a fixed delay after each spike, with the PRC measured when the phasic relationship between the stimulus and the subsequent spike in the neuron has converged. The essential information is the dependence of the recovery time from pulse onset until the next spike as a function of the delay between the previous spike and the onset of the applied pulse. Experimental fPRCs in Aplysia pacemaker neurons were different from single-pulse PRCs, principally due to adaptation. In the biological neuron, convergence to the fully adapted recovery interval was slower at some phases than that at others because the change in the effective intrinsic period due to adaptation changes the effective phase resetting in a way that opposes and slows the effects of adaptation. The fPRCs for two isolated adapting model neurons were used to predict the existence and stability of 1:1 phase-locked network activity when the two neurons were coupled. A stability criterion was derived by linearizing a coupled map based on the fPRC and the existence and stability criteria were successfully tested in two-simulated-neuron networks with reciprocal inhibition or excitation. The fPRC is the first PRC-based tool that can account for adaptation in analyzing networks of neural oscillators.},

title = {Exploring modulation of action potential firing by artificial graft of fast GABAergic autaptic afferences in hypophyseal neuroendocrine melanotrope cells},
abstract = {Excitable cells are connected via electrical and chemical synapses to form a complex plastic network that transmit and modify action potential trains. In vivo and in vitro studies suggest that powerful type A GABAergic self-innervations, known as autapses, play a central role in the shaping of spike discharges. Herein, we have investigated the effects of artificial autaptic activity on action potential firing in cultured hypophyseal neuroendocrine melanotrope cells removed from any synaptic input. Type A autaptic conductances were introduced by using a dedicated dynamic-clamp device, based on a digital signal processor. The results indicate that cells grafted with autaptic dynamic-clamp are subjected to a modulation of both evoked firing and artificial GABA(A)-currents. The autaptic feedback reduced the action potentials amplitude, decreasing both the overshoot and the after-hyperpolarization potential (AHP). In return, the reduced voltage changes diminished the autaptic current amplitudes. The overall effect was a decrease of the cell firing rate. The introduction of a variable autaptic delay strongly altered the cell responses. Under certain conditions, the artificial autaptic current formed an additional component of the AHP which was markedly augmented. This action resulted in a stabilization of the action potential train leading to a more regular firing. In conclusion, it appeared that the autaptic feedback was very dependent on functional parameters such as the autaptic distance. Further investigations are in progress to complete our model, taking the autaptic plasticity into account.},

title = {Exploring parameter space in detailed single neuron models: simulations of the mitral and granule cells of the olfactory bulb},
abstract = {1. Detailed compartmental computer simulations of single mitral and granule cells of the vertebrate olfactory bulb were constructed using previously published geometric data. Electrophysiological properties were determined by comparing model output to previously published experimental data, mainly current-clamp recordings. 2. The passive electrical properties of each model were explored by comparing model output with intracellular potential data from hyperpolarizing current injection experiments. The results suggest that membrane resistivity in both cells is nonuniform, with somatas having a substantially lower resistivity than the dendrites. 3. The active properties of these cells were explored by incorporating active ion channels into modeled compartments. On the basis of evidence from the literature, the mitral cell model included six channel types: fast sodium, fast delayed rectifier (Kfast), slow delayed rectifier (K), transient outward potassium current (KA), voltage- and calcium-dependent potassium current (KCa), and L-type calcium current. The granule cell model included four channel types: rat brain sodium, K, KA, and the non-inactivating muscarinic potassium current (KM). Modeled channels were based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism. 4. Representative kinetics for each of the channel classes above were obtained from the literature. The experimentally unknown spatial distributions of each included channel were obtained by systematic parameter searches. These were conducted in two ways: large-scale simulation series, in which each parameter was varied in turn, and an adaptation of a multidimensional conjugate gradient method. In each case, the simulated results were compared wtih experimental data using a curve-matching function evaluating mean squared differences of several aspects of the simulated and experimental voltage waveforms. 5. Systematic parameter variations revealed a single distinct region of parameter space in which the mitral cell model best fit the data. This region of parameter space was also very robust to parameter variations. Specifically, optimum performance was obtained when calcium and slow K channels were concentrated in the glomeruli, with a lower density in the soma and proximal secondary dendrites. The distribution of sodium and fast potassium channels, on the other hand, was highest at the soma and axon, with a much lighter distribution throughout the secondary dendrites. The KA and KCa channels were also concentrated near the soma. 6. The parameter search of the granule cell model was much less restrained by experimental data. Several parameter regimes were found that gave a good match to the data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

title = {Synaptic depression enables neuronal gain control},
abstract = {To act as computational devices, neurons must perform mathematical operations as they transform synaptic and modulatory input into output firing rate. Experiments and theory indicate that neuronal firing typically represents the sum of synaptic inputs, an additive operation, but multiplication of inputs is essential for many computations. Multiplication by a constant produces a change in the slope, or gain, of the input-output relationship, amplifying or scaling down the sensitivity of the neuron to changes in its input. Such gain modulation occurs in vivo, during contrast invariance of orientation tuning, attentional scaling, translation-invariant object recognition, auditory processing and coordinate transformations. Moreover, theoretical studies highlight the necessity of gain modulation in several of these tasks. Although potential cellular mechanisms for gain modulation have been identified, they often rely on membrane noise and require restrictive conditions to work. Because nonlinear components are used to scale signals in electronics, we examined whether synaptic nonlinearities are involved in neuronal gain modulation. We used synaptic stimulation and the dynamic-clamp technique to investigate gain modulation in granule cells in acute slices of rat cerebellum. Here we show that when excitation is mediated by synapses with short-term depression (STD), neuronal gain is controlled by an inhibitory conductance in a noise-independent manner, allowing driving and modulatory inputs to be multiplied together. The nonlinearity introduced by STD transforms inhibition-mediated additive shifts in the input-output relationship into multiplicative gain changes. When granule cells were driven with bursts of high-frequency mossy fibre input, as observed in vivo, larger inhibition-mediated gain changes were observed, as expected with greater STD. Simulations of synaptic integration in more complex neocortical neurons suggest that STD-based gain modulation can also operate in neurons with large dendritic trees. Our results establish that neurons receiving depressing excitatory inputs can act as powerful multiplicative devices even when integration of postsynaptic conductances is linear.},

title = {A low-affinity antagonist reveals saturation and desensitization in mature synapses in the auditory brain stem},
abstract = {Postsynaptic receptor desensitization has been observed to contribute to depression in immature synapses. However, it is not clear whether desensitization persists and causes depression in mature synapses. We investigate this issue at the endbulb of Held, the synapse made by auditory nerve (AN) fibers onto bushy cells (BCs) of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus, where depression could influence the processing of sound information. Experiments using cyclothiazide (CTZ) have implicated desensitization in endbulbs from postnatal day 16 (P16) to P21 mice, but application of γ-D-glutamylglycine (DGG) did not reveal desensitization in endbulbs >P22. To reconcile these findings, we have studied the effects of both CTZ and DGG on endbulbs from P5 to P40 CBA/CaJ mice. In paired-pulse protocols, both CTZ and DGG reduced depression in all ages at intervals <10 ms, consistent with their effects preventing desensitization. However, DGG increased depression at intervals >20 ms, consistent with DGG's use to prevent saturation. DGG application revealed receptor saturation even under conditions of very low release probability. Preventing desensitization by CTZ occluded the effects of DGG on desensitization and revealed the effects of saturation at short intervals. We developed an approach to separate DGG's effect on saturation from its effect on desensitization, which showed that desensitization has an impact during bursts of auditory nerve activity. Dynamic-clamp experiments indicated that desensitization can reduce BC spike probability and increase latency and jitter. Thus desensitization may affect sound processing in the mature auditory system.},

abstract = {Neuron-machine interfaces such as dynamic clamp and brain-implantable neuroprosthetic devices require real-time simulations of neuronal ion channel dynamics. Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) has emerged as a high-speed digital platform ideal for such application-specific computations. We propose an efficient and flexible component-based FPGA design framework for neuronal ion channel dynamics simulations, which overcomes certain limitations of the recently proposed memory-based approach. A parallel processing strategy is used to minimize computational delay, and a hardware-efficient factoring approach for calculating exponential and division functions in neuronal ion channel models is used to conserve resource consumption. Performances of the various FPGA design approaches are compared theoretically and experimentally in corresponding implementations of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) synaptic ion channel models. Our results suggest that the component-based design framework provides a more memory economic solution, as well as more efficient logic utilization for large word lengths, whereas the memory-based approach may be suitable for time-critical applications where a higher throughput rate is desired.},

title = {Synchronization in hybrid neuronal networks of the hippocampal formation},
abstract = {Understanding the mechanistic bases of neuronal synchronization is a current challenge in quantitative neuroscience. We studied this problem in two putative cellular pacemakers of the mammalian hippocampal theta rhythm: glutamatergic stellate cells (SCs) of the medial entorhinal cortex and GABAergic oriens-lacunosum-moleculare (O-LM) interneurons of hippocampal region CA1. We used two experimental methods. First, we measured changes in spike timing induced by artificial synaptic inputs applied to individual neurons. We then measured responses of free-running hybrid neuronal networks, consisting of biological neurons coupled (via dynamic clamp) to biological or virtual counterparts. Results from the single-cell experiments predicted network behaviors well and are compatible with previous model-based predictions of how specific membrane mechanisms give rise to empirically measured synchronization behavior. Both cell types phase lock stably when connected via homogeneous excitatory-excitatory (E-E) or inhibitory-inhibitory (I-I) connections. Phase-locked firing is consistently synchronous for either cell type with E-E connections and nearly anti - synchronous with I-I connections. With heterogeneous connections (e.g.. excitatory-inhibitory, as might be expected if members of a given population had heterogeneous connections involving intermediate interneurons), networks often settled into phase locking that was either stable or unstable, depending on the order of firing of the two cells in the hybrid network. Our results imply that excitatory SCs, but not inhibitory O-LM interneurons, are capable of synchronizing in phase via monosynaptic mutual connections of the biologically appropriate polarity. Results are largely independent of synaptic strength and synaptic kinetics, implying that our conclusions are robust and largely unaffected by synaptic plasticity.},

title = {Enhancement of synchronization in a hybrid neural circuit by spike-timing dependent plasticity},
abstract = {Synchronization of neural activity is fundamental for many functions of the brain. We demonstrate that spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) enhances synchronization ( entrainment) in a hybrid circuit composed of a spike generator, a dynamic clamp emulating an excitatory plastic synapse, and a chemically isolated neuron from the Aplysia abdominal ganglion. Fixed-phase entrainment of the Aplysia neuron to the spike generator is possible for a much wider range of frequency ratios and is more precise and more robust with the plastic synapse than with a nonplastic synapse of comparable strength. Further analysis in a computational model of Hodgkin - Huxleytype neurons reveals the mechanism behind this significant enhancement in synchronization. The experimentally observed STDP plasticity curve appears to be designed to adjust synaptic strength to a value suitable for stable entrainment of the postsynaptic neuron. One functional role of STDP might therefore be to facilitate synchronization or entrainment of nonidentical neurons.},

Our simple model predicts correctly the timing of 96% of the spikes ( +/- 2 ms) of the detailed model in response to injection of noisy synaptic conductances. The model is especially reliable in high-conductance states, typical of cortical activity in vivo, in which intrinsic conductances were found to have a reduced role in shaping spike trains. These results are promising because this simple model has enough expressive power to reproduce qualitatively several electrophysiological classes described in vitro.},

We here show that Cole's theorem can be used to directly remove the axial component from simulated voltage clamp recordings. It is direct in the sense that it requires neither simulation nor fitting. As it comes down to squaring the clamp current and then differentiating with respect to clamp voltage it may indeed be implemented in real time. When applied to synthetic potassium currents in straight fibers we find that our method accurately and robustly recovers both non-uniform conductances and non-uniform channel kinetics. We indicate the degree to which such accuracy is diminished for cells that taper and/or branch.},

abstract = {The electrical activity of a neuron is strongly dependent on the ionic channels present in its membrane. Modifying the maximal conductances from these channels can have a dramatic impact on neuron behavior. But the effect of such modifications can also be cancelled out by compensatory mechanisms among different channels. We used an evolution strategy with a fitness function based on phase-plane analysis to obtain 20 very different computational models of the cerebellar Purkinje cell. All these models produced very similar outputs to current injections, including tiny details of the complex firing pattern. These models were not completely isolated in the parameter space, but neither did they belong to a large continuum of good models that would exist if weak compensations between channels were sufficient. The parameter landscape of good models can best be described as a set of loosely connected hyperplanes. Our method is efficient in finding good models in this complex landscape. Unraveling the landscape is an important step towards the understanding of functional homeostasis of neurons.},

We studied the behavior of single cells systematically to help resolve this issue. Perforated patch recordings were made from single mouse beta-cells or hamster insulinoma tumor cells in current clamp at 30-35 degrees C, using standard K+-rich pipette solution and external solutions containing 11.1 mM glucose. Dynamic clamp was used to apply artificial KATP and Ca2+ channel conductances to cells in current clamp to assess the role of Ca2+ and KATP channels in single cell firing. The electrical activity we observed in mouse beta-cells was heterogeneous, with three basic patterns encountered: 1) repetitive fast spiking; 2) fast spikes superimposed on brief (<5 s) plateaus; or 3) periodic plateaus of longer duration (10-20 s) with small spikes. Pattern 2 was most similar to islet bursting but was significantly faster. Burst plateaus lasting on the order of minutes were only observed when recordings were made from cell clusters. Adding gCa to cells increased the depolarizing drive of bursting and lengthened the plateaus, whereas adding gKATP hyperpolarized the cells and lengthened the silent phases. Adding gCa and gKATP together did not cancel out their individual effects but could induce robust bursts that resembled those of islets, and with increased period. These added currents had no slow components, indicating that the mechanisms of physiological bursting are likely to be endogenous to single beta-cells. It is unlikely that the fast bursting (class 2) was due to oscillations in gKATP because it persisted in 100 microM tolbutamide. The ability of small exogenous currents to modify beta-cell firing patterns supports the hypothesis that single cells contain the necessary mechanisms for bursting but often fail to exhibit this behavior because of heterogeneity of cell parameters.},

As previously reported, block of SK current with apamin leads to bursting of DCN neurons and a steepening of the f-I curve. We show here that the properties of the slow spike afterhyperpolarization are fully controlled by SK current and we derive kinetic properties of this current that explain its action on DCN neurons. Overall, the SK current provides an effective mechanism to tune the regularity of spiking and the f-I curve of DCN neurons.},

abstract = {The role of synaptic dynamics in processing neural information is investigated in a neural information channel with realistic model neurons having chaotic intrinsic dynamics. Our neuron models are realized in simple analogue circuits, and Our synaptic connections are realized both in analogue circuits and through a dynamic clamp program. The information which is input to the first chaotic neuron in the channel emerges partially absent and partially 'hidden'. Part is absent because of the dynamical effects of the chaotic oscillation that effectively acts as a noisy channel. The 'hidden' part is recoverable. We show that synaptic parameters, most significantly receptor binding time constants, can be tuned to enhance the information transmission by the combination of a neuron plus a synapse. We discuss how the dynamics of the synapse can be used to recover 'hidden' information using average mutual information as a measure of the quality of information transport.},

abstract = {This work explains a mechanism through which the introduction of excitatory synaptic coupling between two model cells, one of which is excitable and the other of which is tonically active when uncoupled, leads to bursting in the resulting two-cell network. This phenomenon can arise when the individual cells are conditional relaxation oscillators, in that they can be tuned to engage in relaxation oscillations, or when they are conditional square-wave bursters. The mechanism is illustrated with a model for conditional pacemaker neurons in the pre-B{\"o}tzinger complex as well as with a reduced form of this model. In the relaxation oscillator case, a periodic bursting solution is proved to exist in the singular limit, under a pair of general conditions. These conditions relate the durations of the silent and active phases of the bursting solution to the locations of certain structures in the phase plane, at appropriate synaptic input strengths. Further, additional conditions on the relative flow rates in the silent and active phases are proved to imply the uniqueness and asymptotic stability of the bursting solution.},

While it has proved to be useful in all kinds of experiments, single electrode stimuli are, however, far from being 'natural'.

In this paper, a multi-electrode stimulating system is introduced which allows for the generation of fast space-time stimulus patterns. An example for the application of dynamic input patterns to the cerebellar cortex in vitro is given.

A model based on all available biophysical data of a two-cell heart interneuron oscillator provides a theoretical basis for understanding this modulation. Previously observed modulation of K+ currents by FMRFamide cannot account for this acceleratory effect in the model. This observation prompted the present reexamination of K+ currents in heart interneurons. We devised better methods for separation of the various components of K+ current and more accurately measured their activation and deactivation kinetics. Moreover, we demonstrated that FMRFamide activates a previously undetected K+ current (I-KF), which has very slow activation and deactivation kinetics. Addition of physiologically measured amounts of I-KF to the model two-cell oscillator can account for the acceleratory effect of FMRFamide.},

title = {Sparse but selective and potent synaptic transmission from the globus pallidus to the subthalamic nucleus},
abstract = {The reciprocally connected GABAergic globus pallidus (GP)-glutamatergic subthalamic nucleus (STN) network is critical for voluntary movement and an important site of dysfunction in movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Although the GP is a key determinant of STN activity, correlated GP-STN activity is rare under normal conditions. Here we define fundamental features of the GP-STN connection that contribute to poorly correlated GP-STN activity. Juxtacellular labeling of single GP neurons in vivo and stereological estimation of the total number of GABAergic GP-STN synapses suggest that the GP-STN connection is surprisingly sparse: single GP neurons maximally contact only 2% of STN neurons and single STN neurons maximally receive input from 2% of GP neurons. However, GP-STN connectivity may be considerably more selective than even these estimates imply. Light and electron microscopic analyses revealed that single GP axons give rise to sparsely distributed terminal clusters, many of which correspond to multiple synapses with individual STN neurons. Application of the minimal stimulation technique in brain slices confirmed that STN neurons receive multisynaptic unitary inputs and that these inputs largely arise from different sets of GABAergic axons. Finally, the dynamic-clamp technique was applied to quantify the impact of GP-STN inputs on STN activity. Small fractions of GP-STN input were sufficiently powerful to inhibit and synchronize the autonomous activity of STN neurons. Together these data are consistent with the conclusion that the rarity of correlated GP-STN activity in vivo is due to the sparsity and selectivity, rather than the potency, of GP-STN synaptic connections.},

abstract = {Spike synchronization underlies information processing and storage in the brain. But how can neurons synchronize in a noisy network? By exploiting a high-speed (500-2,000 fps) multineuron imaging technique and a large-scale synapse mapping method, we directly compared spontaneous activity patterns and anatomical connectivity in hippocampal CA3 networks ex vivo. As compared to unconnected pairs, synaptically coupled neurons shared more common presynaptic neurons, received more correlated excitatory synaptic inputs, and emitted synchronized spikes with approximately 10(7) times higher probability. Importantly, common presynaptic parents per se synchronized more than unshared upstream neurons. Consistent with this, dynamic-clamp stimulation revealed that common inputs alone could not account for the realistic degree of synchronization unless presynaptic spikes synchronized among common parents. On a macroscopic scale, network activity was coordinated by a power-law scaling of synchronization, which engaged varying sets of densely interwired (thus highly synchronized) neuron groups. Thus, locally coherent activity converges on specific cell assemblies, thereby yielding complex ensemble dynamics. These segmentally synchronized pulse packets may serve as information modules that flow in associatively parallel network channels.},

title = {Regulation of the rebound depolarization and spontaneous firing patterns of deep nuclear neurons in slices of rat cerebellum},
abstract = {Current-clamp recordings were made from the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) of 12- to 15-day-old rats to understand the factors that mediate intrinsic spontaneous firing patterns. All of the cells recorded were spontaneously active with spiking patterns ranging continuously from regular spiking to spontaneous bursting with the former predominating. A robust rebound depolarization (RD) leading to a Na(+) spike burst was elicited after the offset of hyperpolarizing current injection. The voltage and time dependence of the RD was consistent with mediation by low-threshold voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. In addition, induction of a RD also may be affected by activation of a hyperpolarization-activated cation current, I(h). A RD could be evoked efficiently after brief high-frequency bursts of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) induced by stimulation of Purkinje cell axons. IPSP-driven RDs were typically much larger and longer than those elicited by direct hyperpolarizing pulses of approximately matched amplitude and duration. Intracellular perfusion of the Ca(2+) buffer bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) dramatically enhanced the RD and its associated spiking, sometimes leading to a plateau potential that lasted several hundred milliseconds. The effects of BAPTA could be mimicked partly by application of apamin, a blocker of small conductance Ca(2+)-gated K(+) channels, but not by paxilline, which blocks large conductance Ca(2+)-gated K(+) channels. Application of both BAPTA and apamin, but not paxilline, caused cells that were regularly spiking to burst spontaneously. Taken together, our data suggest that there is a strong relationship between the ability of DCN cells to elicit a RD and their tendency burst spontaneously. The RD can be triggered by the opening of T-type Ca(2+) channels with an additional contribution of hyperpolarization-activated current I(h). RD duration is regulated by small-conductance Ca(2+)-gated K(+) channels. The RD also is modulated tonically by inhibitory inputs. All of these factors are in turn subject to alteration by extrinsic modulatory neurotransmitters and are, at least in part, responsible for determining the firing modes of DCN neurons.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of state estimation for nonlinear systems by means of the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Compared to the traditional extended Kalman filter, the UKF does not require the local linearization of the system equations used in the propagation stage. Important results using the UKF have been reported recently but in every case the system equations used by the filter were considered known. Not only that, such models are usually considered to be differential equations, which requires that numerical integration be performed during the propagation phase of the filter. In this paper the dynamical equations of the system are taken to be difference equations--thus avoiding numerical integration--and are built from data without prior knowledge. The identified models are subsequently implemented in the filter in order to accomplish state estimation. The paper discusses the impact of not knowing the exact equations and using data-driven models in the context of state and joint state-and-parameter estimation. The procedure is illustrated by means of examples that use simulated and measured data.},

title = {Synaptic background activity influences spatiotemporal integration in single pyramidal cells},
abstract = {The standard one-dimensional Rall cable model assumes that the electrotonic structure of neurons does not change in response to synaptic input. This model is used in a great number of both theoretical and anatomical-physiological structure-function studies. In particular, the membrane time constant, tau m, the somatic input resistance, Rin, and the electrotonic length are used to characterize single cells. However, these studies do not take into account that neurons are embedded in a network of spontaneously active cells. Synapses from these cells will contribute significantly to the membrane conductance, especially if recent evidence of very high specific membrane resistance, Rm = 100 k omega.cm2, is taken into account. We numerically simulated the electrical behavior of an anatomically reconstructed layer V cortical pyramidal cell receiving input from 4000 excitatory and 1000 inhibitory cells firing spontaneously at 0-7 Hz. We found that, over this range of synaptic background activity, tau m and Rin change by a factor of 10 (80-7 msec, 110-14 M omega) and the electrotonic length of the cell changes by a factor of 3. We show that this significantly changes the response of the cell to temporal desynchronized versus temporal synchronized synaptic input distributed throughout the neuron. Thus, the global activity of the network can control how individual cells perform spatial and temporal integration.},

title = {Analysis of distinct short and prolonged components in rebound spiking of deep cerebellar nucleus neurons},
abstract = {Deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN) neurons show pronounced post-hyperpolarization rebound burst behavior, which may contribute significantly to responses to strong inhibitory inputs from cerebellar cortical Purkinje cells. Thus, rebound behavior could importantly shape the output from the cerebellum. We used whole-cell recordings in brain slices to characterize DCN rebound properties and their dependence on hyperpolarization duration and depth. We found that DCN rebounds showed distinct fast and prolonged components, with different stimulus dependence and different underlying currents. The initial depolarization leading into rebound spiking was carried by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated current, and variable expression of this current could lead to a control of rebound latency. The ensuing fast rebound burst was due to T-type calcium current, as previously described. It was highly variable between cells in strength, and could be expressed fully after short periods of hyperpolarization. In contrast, a subsequent prolonged rebound component required longer and deeper periods of hyperpolarization before it was fully established. We found using voltage-clamp and dynamic-clamp analyses that a slowly inactivating persistent sodium current fits the conductance underlying this prolonged rebound component, resulting in spike rate increases over several seconds. Overall, our results demonstrate that multiphasic DCN rebound properties could be elicited differentially by different levels of Purkinje cell activation, and thus create a rich repertoire of potential rebound dynamics in the cerebellar control of motor timing.},

The optimal patterns of synaptic conductances for spike generation in central neurons is a subject of considerable interest. Ideally such conductance time courses should be extracted from membrane potential (V-m) activity, but this is difficult because the nonlinear contribution of conductances to the V m renders their estimation from the membrane equation extremely sensitive. We outline here a solution to this problem based on a discretization of the time axis. This procedure can extract the time course of excitatory and inhibitory conductances solely from the analysis of V-m activity. We test this method by calculating spike-triggered averages of synaptic conductances using numerical simulations of the integrate-and-fire model subject to colored conductance noise. The procedure was also tested successfully in biological cortical neurons using conductance noise injected with dynamic clamp. This method should allow the extraction of synaptic conductances from V-m recordings in vivo.},

title = {Optimizing conductance parameters of cortical neural models via electrotonic partitions},
abstract = {Development of automated methods for fitting computational models to observed biological data is an important challenge of neural modeling. Previous work has focused on generalized search techniques combined with distance measures tuned to specific neural morphologies. We propose general analysis techniques to guide construction of distance measures across a broader range of cell types. Specifically, we evaluate the use of multiple external stimuli to evoke characteristic behaviors of underlying active channel densities on a simple three-compartment model. We also examine the use of frequency analysis to smooth search space distortions induced by temporal shifts in recorded voltage traces. We propose a novel method of parameter optimization that is characterized by linear regression over the conductance densities using channel permissiveness as a basis of ionic current. We derive this method and demonstrate, given known anatomy and kinetics, it will solve all conductance densities in an N compartment model given N spatially distinct membrane potential traces with minimal error. We compare the regression method with the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) over a two-compartment cortical neuron and empirically show that regression over electrotonic partitions solves the cortical model near-optimally. We also show that electronic partitioning significantly improves search performance of CMA-ES on the cortical model.},

title = {Closed-loop, open-source electrophysiology},
abstract = {Multiple extracellular microelectrodes (multi-electrode arrays, or MEAs) effectively record rapidly varying neural signals, and can also be used for electrical stimulation. Multi-electrode recording can serve as artificial output (efferents) from a neural system, while complex spatially and temporally targeted stimulation can serve as artificial input (afferents) to the neuronal network. Multi-unit or local field potential (LFP) recordings can not only be used to control real world artifacts, such as prostheses, computers or robots, but can also trigger or alter subsequent stimulation. Real-time feedback stimulation may serve to modulate or normalize aberrant neural activity, to induce plasticity, or to serve as artificial sensory input. Despite promising closed-loop applications, commercial electrophysiology systems do not yet take advantage of the bidirectional capabilities of multi-electrodes, especially for use in freely moving animals. We addressed this lack of tools for closing the loop with NeuroRighter, an open-source system including recording hardware, stimulation hardware, and control software with a graphical user interface. The integrated system is capable of multi-electrode recording and simultaneous patterned microstimulation (triggered by recordings) with minimal stimulation artifact. The potential applications of closed-loop systems as research tools and clinical treatments are broad; we provide one example where epileptic activity recorded by a multi-electrode probe is used to trigger targeted stimulation, via that probe, to freely moving rodents.},

abstract = {The temporal precision of converting excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) into spikes at pyramidal cells is critical for the coding of information in the cortex. Several in vitro studies have shown that voltage-dependent conductances in pyramidal cells can prolong the EPSP time course resulting in an imprecise EPSP-spike coupling. We have used dynamic-clamp techniques to mimic the in vivo background synaptic conductance in cortical slices and investigated how the ongoing synaptic activity may affect the EPSP time course near threshold and the EPSP spike coupling. We report here that background synaptic conductance dramatically diminished the depolarization related prolongation of the EPSPs in pyramidal cells and improved the precision of spike timing. Furthermore, we found that background synaptic conductance can affect the interaction among action potentials in a spike train. Thus the level of ongoing synaptic activity in the cortex may regulate the capacity of pyramidal cells to process temporal information.},

title = {Multivesicular release differentiates the reliability of synaptic transmission between the visual cortex and the somatosensory cortex},
abstract = {Neurons in layer 4 (L4) of the cortex play an important role in transferring signals from thalamus to other layers of the cortex. Understanding the fundamental properties of synaptic transmission between L4 neurons helps us gain a clear picture of how the neuronal network in L4 cooperates to process sensory information. In the present study, we have determined the underlying parameters that govern synaptic strength, such as quantal size, size of readily releasable vesicle pool, and release probability (Pr) of excitatory synaptic connections within L4 of the visual cortex (V1) and the somatosensory cortex (S1) in mice. Although only a single vesicle is released per release site under physiological conditions at V1 synapses, multivesicular release (MVR) is observed at S1 synapses. In addition, we observed a saturation of postsynaptic receptors at S1 synapses. Other synaptic properties are similar in both cortices. Dynamic clamp experiments suggest that higher Pr and MVR at S1 synapses lower the requirement of the number of synaptic inputs to generate postsynaptic action potentials. In addition, the slower decay of synaptic current and the intrinsic membrane properties of the postsynaptic neuron also contribute to the reliable transmission between S1 neurons.},

We demonstrate how the density of T-type channels determines the behavioral destiny of neurons.

title = {Controlling bursting in cortical cultures with closed-loop multi-electrode stimulation},
abstract = {One of the major modes of activity of high-density cultures of dissociated neurons is globally synchronized bursting. Unlike in vivo, neuronal ensembles in culture maintain activity patterns dominated by global bursts for the lifetime of the culture (up to 2 years). We hypothesize that persistence of bursting is caused by a lack of input from other brain areas. To study this hypothesis, we grew small but dense monolayer cultures of cortical neurons and glia from rat embryos on multi-electrode arrays and used electrical stimulation to substitute for afferents. We quantified the burstiness of the firing of the cultures in spontaneous activity and during several stimulation protocols. Although slow stimulation through individual electrodes increased burstiness as a result of burst entrainment, rapid stimulation reduced burstiness. Distributing stimuli across several electrodes, as well as continuously fine-tuning stimulus strength with closed-loop feedback, greatly enhanced burst control. We conclude that externally applied electrical stimulation can substitute for natural inputs to cortical neuronal ensembles in transforming burst-dominated activity to dispersed spiking, more reminiscent of the awake cortex in vivo. This nonpharmacological method of controlling bursts will be a critical tool for exploring the information processing capacities of neuronal ensembles in vitro and has potential applications for the treatment of epilepsy.},

title = {Modal gating of Na+ channels as a mechanism of persistent Na+ current in pyramidal neurons from rat and cat sensorimotor cortex},
abstract = {The kinetic behavior of brain Na+ channels was studied in pyramidal cells from rat and cat sensorimotor cortex using either the thin slice preparation or acutely isolated neurons. Single-channel recordings were obtained in the cell-attached and inside-out configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Na+ channels had a conductance of about 16 pS. Patches always contained several Na+ channels, usually 4-12. In both preparations, long depolarizing pulses revealed two distinct patterns of late Na+ channel activity following transient openings. (1) Na+ channels displayed sporadic brief late openings sometimes clustered to ''minibursts'' of 10-40 msec. These events occurred at a low frequency, yielding open probability (NP(o)) values below 0.01 (mean = 0.0034). (2) In the second gating mode, an individual Na+ channel in the patch failed to inactivate and produced a burst of openings often lasting to the end of the pulse. This behavior was observed in about 1 % of depolarizations. Shifts to the bursting mode were usually confined to a single 400 msec pulse, but rarely occurred during two or more consecutive pulses applied at 2 sec intervals. Sustained bursts did not require preceding transient openings to occur since they were also observed during slow depolarizing voltage ramps. The similar incidence of inactivation failures in cell-attached versus inside-out recordings suggests that the bursting mode is a property of the channel and/or adjacent membrane-bound structures. Calculations indicate that brief late openings and rare sustained bursts suffice to generate a small but significant whole-cell current. Since the Na+ channels mediating early, brief late, and sustained openings were identical in terms of their elementary electrical properties, we propose that the fast and the persistent Na+ currents of cortical pyramidal cells are generated by an electrophysiologically uniform population of Na+ channels that can individually switch between different gating modes.},

Subjects stood facing forward with their feet together on a force platform. Centre of pressure (CoP) displacement over 26 seconds was measured in the anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) planes. GVS had no significant overall effect on sway in the normal subjects. In the patients a small (4.5%) significant decrease in sway was seen in the ECCS condition with low intensity (0.1 mA) stimulation (P=0.02). Similar changes were seen in the normal subjects. This work indicates that low intensities of stochastic GVS can reduce sway levels in PD patients for certain stance conditions.},

title = {Global structure, robustness, and modulation of neuronal models},
abstract = {The electrical characteristics of many neurons are remarkably robust in the face of changing internal and external conditions. At the same time, neurons can be highly sensitive to neuromodulators. We find correlates of this dual robustness and sensitivity in a global analysis of the structure of a conductance-based model neuron. We vary the maximal conductance parameters of the model neuron and, for each set of parameters tested, characterize the activity pattern generated by the cell as silent, tonically firing, or bursting. Within the parameter space of the five maximal conductances of the model, we find directions, representing concerted changes in multiple conductances, along which the basic pattern of neural activity does not change. In other directions, relatively small concurrent changes in a few conductances can induce transitions between these activity patterns. The global structure of the conductance-space maps implies that neuromodulators that alter a sensitive set of conductances will have powerful, and possibly state-dependent, effects. Other modulators that may have no direct impact on the activity of the neuron may nevertheless change the effects of such direct modulators via this state dependence. Some of the results and predictions arising from the model studies are replicated and verified in recordings of stomatogastric ganglion neurons using the dynamic clamp.},

title = {Potentiation of mossy fiber EPSCs in the cerebellar nuclei by NMDA receptor activation followed by postinhibitory rebound current},
abstract = {Behavioral and computational studies predict that synaptic plasticity of excitatory mossy fiber inputs to cerebellar nuclear neurons is required for associative learning, but standard tetanization protocols fail to potentiate nuclear cell EPSCs in mouse cerebellar slices. Nuclear neurons fire action potentials spontaneously unless strongly inhibited by Purkinje neurons, raising the possibility that plasticity-triggering signals in these cells differ from those at classical Hebbian synapses. Based on predictions of neuronal activity during delay eyelid conditioning, we developed quasi-physiological induction protocols consisting of high-frequency mossy fiber stimulation and postsynaptic hyperpolarization. Robust, NMDA receptor-dependent potentiation of nuclear cell EPSCs occurred with protocols including a 150-250 ms hyperpolarization in which mossy fiber stimulation preceded a postinhibitory rebound depolarization. Mossy fiber stimulation potentiated EPSCs even when postsynaptic spiking was prevented by voltage-clamp, as long as rebound current was evoked. These data suggest that Purkinje cell inhibition guides the strengthening of excitatory synapses in the cerebellar nuclei.},

title = {Slow and persistent postinhibitory rebound acts as an intrinsic short-term memory mechanism},
abstract = {Many neurons exhibit postinhibitory rebound (PIR), in which neurons display enhanced excitability following inhibition. PIR can strongly influence the timing of spikes on rebound from an inhibitory input. We studied PIR in the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab Cancer borealis. The LP neuron is part of the pyloric network, a central pattern generator that normally oscillates with a period of approximately 1 s. We used the dynamic clamp to create artificial rhythmic synaptic inputs of various periods and duty cycles in the LP neuron. Surprisingly, we found that the strength of PIR increased slowly over multiple cycles of synaptic input. Moreover, this increased excitability persisted for 10-20 s after the rhythmic inhibition was removed. These effects are considerably slower than the rhythmic activity typically observed in LP. Thus this slow postinhibitory rebound allows the neuron to adjust its level of excitability to the average level of inhibition over many cycles, and is another example of an intrinsic "short-term memory" mechanism.},

The purpose is to explore cellular sensory gating mechanisms that regulate the transfer efficiency of signals during different sleep-wake states. Hybrid technology is applied in vitro to different paradigms such as: (1) simulating interactions between biological thalamocortical neurons, artificial reticular thalamic inhibitory interneurons and a simulated sensory input, (2) grafting an artificial sensory input to a wholly biological thalamic network that generates spontaneous sleep-like oscillations, (3) injecting in thalamocortical neurons a background synaptic bombardment mimicking the activity of corticothalamic inputs. We show that the graded control of the strength of intrathalamic inhibition, combined with the membrane polarization and the fluctuating synaptic noise in thalamocortical neurons, is able to govern functional shifts between different input/output transmission states of the thalamic gate.},

title = {A non-parametric electrode model for intracellular recording},
abstract = {We present a new way to model the response of an electrode to an injected current. The electrode is represented by an unknown complex linear circuit, characterized by a kernel which we determine by injecting a noisy current. We show both in simulations and experiments that, when applied to a full recording setup (including acquisition board and amplifier), the method captures not only the characteristics of the electrode, but also those of all the devices between the computer and the tip of the electrode, including filters and the capacitance neutralization circuit on the amplifier. Simulations show that the method allows correct predictions of the response of complex electrode models. Finally, we successfully apply the technique to challenging intracellular recording situations in which the voltage across the electrode during injection needs to be subtracted from the recording, in particular conductance injection with the dynamic clamp protocol. We show in numerical simulations and confirm with experiments that the method performs well in cases when both bridge recording and recording in discontinuous mode (DCC) exhibit artefacts.

title = {Role of persistent sodium current in mouse preB{\"o}tzinger Complex neurons and respiratory rhythm generation},
abstract = {Breathing movements in mammals depend on respiratory neurons in the preB{\"o}tzinger Complex (preB{\"o}tC), which comprise a rhythmic network and generate robust bursts that form the basis for inspiration. Persistent Na(+) current (I(NaP)) is widespread in the preB{\"o}tC and is hypothesized to play a critical role in rhythm generation because of its subthreshold activation and slow inactivation properties that putatively promote long-lasting burst depolarizations. In neonatal mouse slice preparations that retain the preB{\"o}tC and generate a respiratory-related rhythm, we tested the role of I(NaP) with multiple Na(+) channel antagonists: tetrodotoxin (TTX; 20 nM), riluzole (RIL; 10 microM), and the intracellular Na(+) channel antagonist QX-314 (2 mM). Here we show that I(NaP) promotes intraburst spiking in preB{\"o}tC neurons but surprisingly does not contribute to the depolarization that underlies inspiratory bursts, i.e. the inspiratory drive potential. Local microinjection in the preB{\"o}tC of 10 microM RIL or 20 nM TTX does not perturb respiratory frequency, even in the presence of bath-applied 100 microM flufenamic acid (FFA), which attenuates a Ca(2+)-activated non-specific cation current (I(CAN)) that may also have burst-generating functionality. These data contradict the hypothesis that I(NaP) in preB{\"o}tC neurons is obligatory for rhythmogenesis. However, in the presence of FFA, local microinjection of 10 microM RIL in the raphe obscurus causes rhythm cessation, which suggests that I(NaP) regulates the excitability of neurons outside the preB{\"o}tC, including serotonergic raphe neurons that project to, and help maintain, rhythmic preB{\"o}tC function.},

title = {Cell type-specific control of neuronal responsiveness by gamma-band oscillatory inhibition},
abstract = {Neocortical networks are composed of diverse populations of cells that differ in their chemical content, electrophysiological characteristics, and connectivity. Gamma-frequency oscillatory activity of inhibitory subnetworks has been hypothesized to regulate information processing in the cortex as a whole. Inhibitory neurons in these subnetworks synchronize their firing and selectively innervate the perisomatic compartments of their target neurons, generating both tonic and rapidly fluctuating inhibition. How do different types of cortical neurons respond to changes in the level and structure of perisomatic inhibition? What accounts for response heterogeneity between cell types, and are these response properties fixed or flexible? To answer these questions, we use in vitro whole-cell recording and dynamic-clamp somatic current injection to study six distinct types of cortical neurons. We demonstrate that different types of neurons systematically vary in their receptiveness to fast changes in the structure of inhibition and the range over which changes in inhibitory tone affect their output. Using simple neuron models and model neuron hybrids (dynamic clamp), we determine which intrinsic differences between cell types lead to these variations in receptiveness. These results suggest important differences in the way cell types are affected by gamma-frequency inhibition, which may have important circuit level implications. Although intrinsic differences observed in vitro are useful for the elucidation of basic cellular properties and differences between cell types, we also investigate how the integrative properties of neurons are likely to be rapidly modulated in the context of active networks in vivo.},

abstract = {Reflected at any level of organization of the central nervous system, most of the processes ranging from ion channels to neuronal networks occur in a closed loop, where the input to the system depends on its output. In contrast, most in vitro preparations and experimental protocols operate autonomously, and do not depend on the output of the studied system. Thanks to the progress in digital signal processing and real-time computing, it is now possible to artificially close the loop and investigate biophysical processes and mechanisms under increased realism. In this contribution, we review some of the most relevant examples of a new trend in in vitro electrophysiology, ranging from the use of dynamic-clamp to multi-electrode distributed feedback stimulation. We are convinced these represents the beginning of new frontiers for the in vitro investigation of the brain, promising to open the still existing borders between theoretical and experimental approaches while taking advantage of cutting edge technologies.},

abstract = {In recent years, new research has brought the field of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfacing (BCI) out of its infancy and into a phase of relative maturity through many demonstrated prototypes such as brain-controlled wheelchairs, keyboards, and computer games. With this proof-of-concept phase in the past, the time is now ripe to focus on the development of practical BCI technologies that can be brought out of the lab and into real-world applications. In particular, we focus on the prospect of improving the lives of countless disabled individuals through a combination of BCI technology with existing assistive technologies (AT). In pursuit of more practical BCIs for use outside of the lab, in this paper, we identify four application areas where disabled individuals could greatly benefit from advancements in BCI technology, namely, "Communication and Control", "Motor Substitution", "Entertainment", and "Motor Recovery". We review the current state of the art and possible future developments, while discussing the main research issues in these four areas. In particular, we expect the most progress in the development of technologies such as hybrid BCI architectures, user-machine adaptation algorithms, the exploitation of users' mental states for BCI reliability and confidence measures, the incorporation of principles in human-computer interaction (HCI) to improve BCI usability, and the development of novel BCI technology including better EEG devices.},

title = {Robust observer-based tracking control of hodgkin-huxley neuron systems under environmental disturbances},
abstract = {A nervous system consists of a large number of highly interconnected nerve cells. Nerve cells communicate by generation and transmission of short electrical pulses (action potential). In addition, membrane voltage is the only measurable state in nervous systems. A robust observer-based model reference tracking control is proposed for Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron systems to generate a desired reference response in spite of environmental noises, uncertain initial values, and diffusion currents from other interconnected nerve cells. In order to simplify the robust tracking control design of nonlinear stochastic HH neuron systems, a fuzzy interpolation method is employed to interpolate several linear stochastic systems to approximate a nonlinear stochastic HH neuron system so that the nonlinear robust tracking control problem can be solved by the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique with the help of Robust Control Toolbox in Matlab. The proposed robust observer-based tracking control scheme can provide new methods for desired action potential generation, suppression of oscillations, and blockage of action potential transmission under environmental noise and diffusion currents. These new methods are useful for patients with different neuron system dysfunctions. Finally, three simulation examples of tracking control of nervous systems are given to illustrate the design procedure and confirm the tracking performance of the proposed method.},

title = {Multiple time scales of temporal response in pyramidal and fast spiking cortical neurons},
abstract = {Neural dynamic processes correlated over several time scales are found in vivo, in stimulus-evoked as well as spontaneous activity, and are thought to affect the way sensory stimulation is processed. Despite their potential computational consequences, a systematic description of the presence of multiple time scales in single cortical neurons is lacking. In this study, we injected fast spiking and pyramidal (PYR) neurons in vitro with long-lasting episodes of step-like and noisy, in-vivo-like current. Several processes shaped the time course of the instantaneous spike frequency, which could be reduced to a small number (1-4) of phenomenological mechanisms, either reducing (adapting) or increasing (facilitating) the neuron's firing rate over time. The different adaptation/ facilitation processes cover a wide range of time scales, ranging from initial adaptation (< 10 ms, PYR neurons only), to fast adaptation (< 300 ms), early facilitation (0.5-1 s, PYR only), and slow (or late) adaptation (order of seconds). These processes are characterized by broad distributions of their magnitudes and time constants across cells, showing that multiple time scales are at play in cortical neurons, even in response to stationary stimuli and in the presence of input fluctuations. These processes might be part of a cascade of processes responsible for the power-law behavior of adaptation observed in several preparations, and may have far-reaching computational consequences that have been recently described.},

title = {Diversity beyond variance: modulation of firing rates and network coherence by GABAergic subpopulations},
abstract = {Computational modelling studies have revealed that heterogeneity in interneuronal networks can powerfully modulate firing rates, responses to excitatory inputs, theta-gamma oscillations and network synchrony. In these previous studies, heterogeneity was represented by the degree of variance in various interneuronal synaptic and cellular parameters. However, a major characteristic of gamma-amino-butyric-acid-ergic (GABAergic) synaptic and interneuronal populations is the presence of distinct subgroups, which variance-based approaches cannot fully address. Here we apply an information theory-based measure of diversity, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (equivalent to entropy), which takes into account both the number and relative abundance of categories within a population. Computational modelling data and experimental dynamic clamp results show that increasing the diversity index in the somatically injected inhibitory post synaptic currents (IPSC) peak conductances modulates the firing rates of CA1 pyramidal cells in a predictable manner that depends on both the mean and variance of the IPSC conductance. Furthermore, increases in the diversity index in interneuronal populations strongly decreased network coherence, even when population variance, the previously applied measure of heterogeneity, remained unchanged. These modelling and experimental results reveal a new approach to the study of interneuronal heterogeneity, and demonstrate the modulation of principal cell firing rates and interneuronal network coherence by parameter clustering at both the synaptic and cellular levels.},

title = {Synchronization as a mechanism for attentional gain modulation},
abstract = {Responses of neurons in monkey visual cortex are modulated when attention is directed into the receptive field of the neuron: the gain or sensitivity of the response is increased or the synchronization of the spikes to the local field potential (LFP) is increased. We investigated, using model simulations, whether the synchrony of inhibitory networks could link these observations. We found that, indeed, an increase in inhibitory synchrony could enhance the coherence of the model neurons with the simulated LFP, and could have different effects on the firing rate. When the firing rate vs. current (f-I) response curves saturated at high I, attention yielded a shift in sensitivity; alternatively, when the f-I curves were non-saturating, the most significant effect was on the gain of the response. This suggests that attention may act through changes in the synchrony of inhibitory networks. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

title = {Low-threshold, persistent sodium current in rat large dorsal root ganglion neurons in culture},
abstract = {Dorsal root ganglion neurons from adult rats (greater than or equal to 200 g) were maintained in culture for between 1 and 3 days. Membrane currents generated by large neurons (50-75 mu m apparent diameter) were recorded with the whole cell patch-clamp technique. Large neurons generated transient Na+ currents and at least two types of inward current that persisted throughout 200-ms voltage-clamp steps to +20 mV. One persistent current activated close to -35 mV (high threshold), whereas in about half of the cells another persistent current began to activate negative to -70 mV (low threshold). The high-threshold persistent current was identified as a Ca2+ current, as previously described in these neurons. The low-threshold current was reversibly suppressed either by replacing external Na+ with tetramethylammonium ions or by reducing external Na+ concentration ([Na+]) and simultaneously raising external [Ca2+]. It was blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX) with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant in the single nanomolar range, We conclude that the low-threshold current is a TTX-sensitive, persistent Na+ current. The persistent TTX-sensitive current contributed to steady-state membrane current from at least -70 mV to 0 mV, a wider potential range than predicted by activation-inactivation gating overlap for transient Na+ current. Because of its low threshold and fast activation kinetics, the persistent Na+ current is expected to play an important role in determining membrane excitability.},

abstract = {Inspired by the dynamic clamp of cellular neuroscience, this paper introduces VPI -- Virtual Partner Interaction -- a coupled dynamical system for studying real time interaction between a human and a machine. In this proof of concept study, human subjects coordinate hand movements with a virtual partner, an avatar of a hand whose movements are driven by a computerized version of the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) equations that have been shown to govern basic forms of human coordination. As a surrogate system for human social coordination, VPI allows one to examine regions of the parameter space not typically explored during live interactions. A number of novel behaviors never previously observed are uncovered and accounted for. Having its basis in an empirically derived theory of human coordination, VPI offers a principled approach to human-machine interaction and opens up new ways to understand how humans interact with human-like machines including identification of underlying neural mechanisms.},

title = {Somatic Ca2+ transients do not contribute to inspiratory drive in preB{\"o}tzinger Complex neurons},
abstract = {PreB{\"o}tzinger Complex (preB{\"o}tC) neurons are postulated to underlie respiratory rhythm generation. The inspiratory phase of the respiratory cycle in vitro results from preB{\"o}tC neurons firing synchronous bursts of action potentials (APs) on top of 10-20 mV, 0.3-0.8 s inspiratory drive potentials. Is the inspiratory drive in individual neurons simply the result of the passive integration of inspiratory-modulated synaptic currents or do active processes modulate these currents? As somatic Ca(2+) is known to increase during inspiration, we hypothesized that it affects inspiratory drive. We combined whole cell recording in an in vitro slice preparation with Ca(2+) microfluorometry to detect single inspiratory neuron somatic Ca(2+) transients with high temporal resolution ( approximately mus). In neurons loaded with either Fluo-4 or Oregon Green BAPTA 5 N, we observed Ca(2+) transients associated with each AP. During inspiration, significant somatic Ca(2+) influx was a direct consequence of activation of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels by APs. However, when we isolated the inspiratory drive potential in active preB{\"o}tC neurons (by blocking APs with intracellular QX-314 or by hyperpolarization), we did not detect somatic Ca(2+) transients; yet, the parameters of inspiratory drive were the same with or without APs. We conclude that, in the absence of APs, somatic Ca(2+) transients do not shape the somatic inspiratory drive potential. This suggests that in preB{\"o}tC neurons, substantial and widespread somatic Ca(2+) influx is a consequence of APs during the inspiratory phase and does not contribute substantively to the inspiratory drive potential. Given evidence that the Ca(2+) buffer BAPTA can significantly reduce inspiratory drive, we hypothesize that dendritic Ca(2+) transients amplify inspiratory-modulated synaptic currents.},

title = {Neural excitability, spiking and bursting},
abstract = {Bifurcation mechanisms involved in the generation of action potentials (spikes) by neurons are reviewed here. We show how the type of bifurcation determines the neuro-computational properties of the cells. For example, when the rest state is near a saddle-node bifurcation, the cell can fire all-or-none spikes with an arbitrary low frequency, it has a well-defined threshold manifold, and it acts as an integrator; i.e. the higher the frequency of incoming pulses, the sooner it fires. In contrast, when the rest state is near an Andronov-Hopf bifurcation, the cell fires in a certain frequency range, its spikes are not all-or-none, it does not have a well-defined threshold manifold, it call fire in response to an inhibitory pulse, and it acts as a resonator; i.e. it responds preferentially to a certain (resonant) frequency of the input. Increasing the input frequency may actually delay or terminate its firing. We also describe the phenomenon of neural bursting, and we use geometric bifurcation theory to extend the existing classification of bursters, including many new types. We discuss how the type of burster defines its neuro-computational properties, and we show that different bursters can interact, synchronize and process information differently.},

RPCH produced several-fold increases in the amplitude of both action potential-mediated and non-impulse-mediated transmission that persisted for as long as the peptide remained present. Because the LP to PD synapse is the only feedback to the pacemaker kernel of the pyloric network, which consists of the electrically coupled two PD neurons and the anterior burster (AB) neuron, it might have been expected that strengthening the LP to PD synapse would increase the period of the pyloric rhythm. However, the period of the pyloric rhythm increased only transiently in RPCH, and a transient increase in cycle period was observed even when the LP neuron was hyperpolarized. Phase response curves were measured using the dynamic clamp to create artificial inhibitory inputs of variable strength and duration to the PD neurons. Synaptic conductance values seen in normal saline were ineffective at changing the pyloric period throughout the pyloric cycle. Conductances similar to those seen in 10(-6) M RPCH also did not evoke phase resets at phases when the LP neuron is typically active. Thus the dramatic effects of RPCH on synaptic strength have little role in modulation of the period of the pyloric rhythm under normal operating conditions but may help to stabilize the rhythm when the cycle period is too slow or too fast.},

title = {Postsynaptic targets of Purkinje cell terminals in the cerebellar and vestibular nuclei of the rat},
abstract = {The cerebellar and vestibular nuclei consist of a heterogeneous group of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. A major proportion of the inhibitory neurons provides a GABAergic feedback to the inferior olive, while the excitatory neurons exert more direct effects on motor control via non-olivary structures. At present is is not clear whether Purkinje cells innervate all types of neurons in the cerebellar and vestibular nuclei or whether an individual Purkinje cell axon can innervate different types of neurons. In the present study, we studied the postsynaptic targets of Purkinje cell axons in the rat using a combination of pre-embedding immunolabelling of the Purkinje cell terminals by L7, a Purkinje cell-specific marker, and postembedding GABA and glycine immunocytochemistry. In the cerebellar nuclei, vestibular nuclei and nucleus prepositus hypoglossi Purkinje cell terminals were found apposed to GABAergic and glycinergic neurons as well as to larger non-GABAergic, non-glycinergic neurons. In the cerebellar and vestibular nuclei individual Purkinje cell terminals innervated both the inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Both types of neurons were contacted no only by non-GABAergic Purkinje cell terminals but also by GABA-containing terminals that were not labelled for L7 and by non-GABAergic, non-glycinergic terminals that formed excitatory synapses. Glycine-containing terminals were relatively scarce ( < 2% of the GABA-containing terminals) and frequently contacted the larger non-GABAergic, non-glycinergic neurons. To summarize, Purkinje cell axons evoke their effects through different types of neurons present in the cerebellar and vestibular nuclear complex. The observation that individual Purkinje cells can innervate both excitatory and inhibitory neurons suggests that the excitatory cerebellar output system and the inhibitory feedback to the inferior olive are controlled simultaneously.},

title = {T current potentiation increases the occurrence and temporal fidelity of synaptically evoked burst firing in sensory thalamic neurons},
abstract = {A growing number of in vivo experiments shows that high frequency bursts of action potentials can be recorded in thalamocortical neurons of awake animals. The mechanism underlying these bursts, however, remains controversial, because they have been proposed to depend on T-type Ca(2+) channels that are inactivated at the depolarized membrane potentials usually associated with the awake state. Here, we show that the transient potentiation of the T current amplitude, which is induced by neuronal depolarization, drastically increases the probability of occurrence and the temporal precision of T-channel-dependent high frequency bursts. The data, therefore, provides the first biophysical mechanism that might account for the generation of these high frequency bursts of action potentials in the awake state. Remarkably, this regulation finely tunes the response of thalamocortical neurons to the corticofugal excitatory and intrathalamic inhibitory afferents but not to sensory inputs.},

We study a simplified model, based on the proposal of Feldman and Del Negro (FDN) [Nat. Rev.

The dynamics of this randomly connected network of identical excitatory neurons differ from those of a uniformly connected one. Specifically, network connectivity determines the identity of emergent leader neurons that trigger the firing bursts. When neuronal desensitization is controlled by the number of input signals to the neurons (as proposed by FDN), the network's collective desensitization--required for successful burst termination--is mediated by k-core clusters of neurons.},

abstract = {The use of voltage clamp with a single electrode has been useful in estimating kinetic parameters for a number of ionic whole-cell currents. There are two main types of such a technique: discontinuous voltage clamp (dSEVC) (Brennecke and Lindemann, 1974), and continuous voltage clamp (cSEVC) (Hamill et al., 1981). We have studied, by means of computer simulations, the performance of both types of clamp on estimating activation kinetics parameters of a typical neuronal Ca2+ current. Deviations from the theoretical values are shown to be sensitive on both set-up and cell properties. Both types of clamp are shown to lose voltage control when either access resistance or absolute membrane conductance are increased. In contrast, changes in membrane capacitance affect differently to the estimates obtained by the two types of clamp. Cell size is also shown to affect cSEVC performance but not that of dSEVC. The nature and magnitude of errors obtained by using both types of clamp in different situations are discussed.},

title = {Reliable neuromodulation from circuits with variable underlying structure},
abstract = {Recent work argues that similar network performance can result from highly variable sets of network parameters, raising the question of whether neuromodulation can be reliable across individuals with networks with different sets of synaptic strengths and intrinsic membrane conductances. To address this question, we used the dynamic clamp to construct 2-cell reciprocally inhibitory networks from gastric mill (GM) neurons of the crab stomatogastric ganglion. When the strength of the artificial inhibitory synapses (g(syn)) and the conductance of an artificial I(h) (g(h)) were varied with the dynamic clamp, a variety of network behaviors resulted, including regions of stable alternating bursting. Maps of network output as a function of g(syn) and g(h) were constructed in normal saline and again in the presence of serotonin or oxotremorine. Both serotonin and oxotremorine depolarize and excite isolated individual GM neurons, but by different cellular mechanisms. Serotonin and oxotremorine each increased the size of the parameter regions that supported alternating bursting, and, on average, increased burst frequency. Nonetheless, in both cases some parameter sets within the sample space deviated from the mean population response and decreased in frequency. These data provide insight into why pharmacological treatments that work in most individuals can generate anomalous actions in a few individuals, and they have implications for understanding the evolution of nervous systems.},

We show that shifts in the activation curve and the maximal conductance of the response produce different effects on the target neuron. 4.

abstract = {The mechanism underlying spike timing-dependent neuromodulation (STDN) was investigated in the opisthobranch mollusc Tritonia diomedea. The serotonergic dorsal swim interneurons (DSIs) dynamically modulated the synaptic output of ventral swim interneuron B (VSI); immediately after DSI stimulation, there was a potentiation of VSI synaptic strength followed by a longer-lasting synaptic depression. The potentiation phase of STDN was unaffected by spike broadening produced by the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). In contrast, the depression phase was eliminated by 4-AP. Bath-applied serotonin (5-HT) decreased VSI spike duration and increased the magnitude of the A-current (I-A), a voltage-dependent, transient, outward current. 4-AP preferentially blocked I-A and prevented the spike narrowing caused by 5-HT, uncovering the full extent of 5-HT-induced synaptic potentiation. A consistent correlation was observed between IA and spike duration, but the correlation between synaptic strength and spike duration differed between preparations. Conductance-based simulations showed that the magnitude of A-current conductance could affect spike duration and gave an estimation of the change needed to produce spike narrowing. An artificial IA introduced into the VSI in the presence of 4-AP by means of the dynamic-clamp technique restored spike duration and gave a further approximation of the magnitude of modulation needed for spike narrowing. Together, these results suggest a mechanism for STDN: the DSIs release 5-HT, which causes a spike duration-independent enhancement of synaptic strength and a longer-lasting enhancement of I-A that narrows the VSI spike and hence decreases VSI synaptic strength. Thus, STDN arises from the dynamics of independent intracellular signaling events.},

title = {Long-term enhancement of neuronal excitability and temporal fidelity mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5},
abstract = {The cellular substrate for memory is generally attributed to long-lasting changes in synaptic strength. We report here that synaptic or pharmacological activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) induces long-term potentiation of intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE) in layer V pyramidal neurons. mGluR5-dependent LTP-IE was associated with a persistent reduction of the after-hyperpolarization (AHP) outward current (I-AHP), resulting in the potentiation of EPSP-spike coupling. Apamin occluded induction of LTP-IE, indicating that downregulation of small conductance calcium-dependent potassium (SK) channels mediates this process. In addition to the improved reliability of the input-output function, LTP-IE led to increased temporal precision. The induced reduction of IAHP accelerated the rate of membrane depolarization preceding each action potential and subsequently decreased the jitter of the neuronal discharge. We conclude that mGluR5-dependent LTP-IE not only promotes the spread of excitation in the cortical network but also persistently enhances the temporal fidelity of the neuronal message.},

abstract = {A persistent change in neuronal activity after brief stimuli is a common feature of many neuronal microcircuits. This persistent activity can be sustained by ongoing reverberant network activity or by the intrinsic biophysical properties of individual cells. Here we demonstrate that rat and guinea pig cerebellar Purkinje cells in vivo show bistability of membrane potential and spike output on the time scale of seconds. The transition between membrane potential states can be bidirectionally triggered by the same brief current pulses. We also show that sensory activation of the climbing fiber input can switch Purkinje cells between the two states. The intrinsic nature of Purkinje cell bistability and its control by sensory input can be explained by a simple biophysical model. Purkinje cell bistability may have a key role in the short-term processing and storage of sensory information in the cerebellar cortex.},

title = {Dynamical principles in neuroscience},
abstract = {Dynamical modeling of neural systems and brain functions has a history of success over the last half century. This includes, for example, the explanation and prediction of some features of neural rhythmic behaviors. Many interesting dynamical models of learning and memory based on physiological experiments have been suggested over the last two decades. Dynamical models even of consciousness now exist. Usually these models and results are based on traditional approaches and paradigms of nonlinear dynamics including dynamical chaos. Neural systems are, however, an unusual subject for nonlinear dynamics for several reasons: (i) Even the simplest neural network, with only a few neurons and synaptic connections, has an enormous number of variables and control parameters. These make neural systems adaptive and flexible, and are critical to their biological function. (ii) In contrast to traditional physical systems described by well-known basic principles, first principles governing the dynamics of neural systems are unknown. (iii) Many different neural systems exhibit similar dynamics despite having different architectures and different levels of complexity. (iv) The network architecture and connection strengths are usually not known in detail and therefore the dynamical analysis must, in some sense, be probabilistic. (v) Since nervous systems are able to organize behavior based on sensory inputs, the dynamical modeling of these systems has to explain the transformation of temporal information into combinatorial or combinatorial-temporal codes, and vice versa, for memory and recognition. In this review these problems are discussed in the context of addressing the stimulating questions: What can neuroscience learn from nonlinear dynamics, and what can nonlinear dynamics learn from neuroscience?},

abstract = {Complex spike activity was simultaneously recorded from 96 Purkinje cells in the rat cerebellar cortex. Rostrocaudal complex spike synchronicity bands were studied in crus I, IIa and IIb and in vermal lobule 6c. Detailed analysis in crus IIa revealed that complex spike activity was staggered sequentially with a 20201350 cm/sec 'propagation velocity' in the mediolateral direction, and that such activity was bilaterally synchronous. The 'propagation' of complex spike activity was symmetrical between right and left crus IIa. Temporally, the neurons that aligned in the rostrocaudal direction typically generated complex spikes close to simultaneously. The correlation of complex spike firing was high between crus IIa and crus IIb, moderate between crus IIa and vermis 6c, and relatively low between Purkinje cells in crus I and crus IIa. These results indicate that, whilst discrete boarders exist between different isochronicity bands, these bands do communicate with each other in the mediolateral direction via slow 'propagation waves' that loosely bind their activity. The results indicate that the olivocerebellar system is organized, bilaterally, to take advantage of the timing signals generated at the inferior olive nucleus.},

Studies show that the activity of individual neurons changes considerably from day to day. We propose to implement a dual Kalman structure to track neural tuning during the decoding process. While the kinematics are inferred as the state from the observation of neuron firing rates, the preferred direction of neuron tuning is also optimized by dual Kalman filtering on the linear coefficients of the observation model. When compared with the fixed tuning Kalman filter, the decoding performance of the adaptive dual Kalman filter is better (less Normalized Mean Square Error), which means that the evolving tuning of motor neuron is being tracked.},

title = {Threshold firing frequency - Current relationships of neurons in rat somatosensory cortex: Type 1 and type 2 dynamics},
abstract = {Neurons and dynamical models of spike generation display two different types of threshold behavior, with steady current stimulation: type 1 [the firing frequency vs. current (f-I) relationship is continuous at threshold) and type 2 (discontinuous f-I)]. The dynamics at threshold can have profound effects on the encoding of input as spikes, the sensitivity of spike generation to input noise, and the coherence of population firing. We have examined the f-I and frequency-conductance (f-g) relationships of cells in layer 2/3 of slices of young (15-21 DIV) rat somatosensory cortex, focusing in detail on the nature of the threshold. Using white-noise stimulation, we also measured firing frequency and inter-spike interval variability as a function of noise amplitude. Regular-spiking (RS) pyramidal neurons show a type 1 threshold, consistent with their well-known ability to fire regularly at very low frequencies. In fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons, although regular firing is supported over a wide range of frequencies, there is a clear discontinuity in their f-I relationship at threshold (type 2), which has not previously been highlighted. FS neurons are unable to support maintained periodic firing below a critical frequency f(c), in the range of 10 to 30 Hz. Very close to threshold, FS cells switch irregularly between bursts of periodic firing and subthreshold oscillations. These characteristics mean that the dynamics of RS neurons are well suited to encoding inputs into low-frequency firing rates, whereas the dynamics of FS neurons are suited to maintaining and quickly synchronizing to gamma and higher-frequency input.},

title = {Balanced excitatory and inhibitory inputs to cortical neurons decouple firing irregularity from rate modulations},
abstract = {In vivo cortical neurons are known to exhibit highly irregular spike patterns. Because the intervals between successive spikes fluctuate greatly, irregular neuronal firing makes it difficult to estimate instantaneous firing rates accurately. If, however, the irregularity of spike timing is decoupled from rate modulations, the estimate of firing rate can be improved. Here, we introduce a novel coding scheme to make the firing irregularity orthogonal to the firing rate in information representation. The scheme is valid if an interspike interval distribution can be well fitted by the gamma distribution and the firing irregularity is constant over time. We investigated in a computational model whether fluctuating external inputs may generate gamma process-like spike outputs, and whether the two quantities are actually decoupled. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of cortical neurons were performed to confirm the predictions of the model. The output spikes were well fitted by the gamma distribution. The firing irregularity remained approximately constant regardless of the firing rate when we injected a balanced input, in which excitatory and inhibitory synapses are activated concurrently while keeping their conductance ratio fixed. The degree of irregular firing depended on the effective reversal potential set by the balance between excitation and inhibition. In contrast, when we modulated conductances out of balance, the irregularity varied with the firing rate. These results indicate that the balanced input may improve the efficiency of neural coding by clamping the firing irregularity of cortical neurons. We demonstrate how this novel coding scheme facilitates stimulus decoding.},

title = {Kv7/KCNQ channels control action potential phasing of pyramidal neurons during hippocampal gamma oscillations in vitro},
abstract = {While the synaptic mechanisms involved in the generation of in vitro network oscillations have been widely studied, little is known about the importance of voltage-gated currents during such activity. Here we study the role of the M-current (I(M)) in the modulation of network oscillations in the gamma-frequency range (20-80 Hz). Kv7/KCNQ subunits, the molecular correlates of I(M), are abundantly expressed in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons, and I(M) is an important modulator of pyramidal neuron firing. Using hippocampal slices, we recorded field activity and pyramidal neuron action potential timing during kainate-induced gamma oscillations. Application of the specific I(M) blocker XE991 causes a significant reduction of gamma oscillation amplitude with no significant change in oscillation frequency. Concomitant CA3 pyramidal neuron recordings show a significant increase in action potential frequency during ongoing gamma oscillations after the application of XE991. This increase is associated with a significant loss of periodicity of pyramidal neuron action potentials relative to the phase of the gamma oscillations. Using dynamic clamp, we show that I(M) acts to improve the periodicity of action potential timing and to decrease action potential frequency. We further validate these results in a compartmental model of a pyramidal neuron. Our work suggests that I(M) modulates gamma oscillations by regulating the phasing of action potential firing in pyramidal neurons.},

title = {Control of neuronal persistent activity by voltage-dependent dendritic properties},
abstract = {Neural integrators and working memory rely on persistent activity, a widespread neural phenomenon potentially involving persistent sodium conductances. Using a unique combination of voltage-clamp, dynamic-clamp, and frequency-domain techniques, we have investigated the role of voltage-dependent conductances on the dendritic electrotonic structure of neurons of the prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN), which is known to be involved in oculomotor integration. The PHN contains two main neuronal populations: type B neurons with a double afterhyperpolarization and type D neurons, which not only are oscillatory but also have a greater electrotonic length than that of type B neurons. The persistent sodium conductance is present in all PHN neurons, although its effect on the dynamic electrotonic structure is shown to significantly differ in the two major cell types present in the nucleus. The electrotonic differences are such that the persistent sodium conductance can be almost perfectly manipulated in a type B neuron using an on-line dynamic clamp to add or subtract virtual sodium ion channels. The dynamic-clamp results are confirmed by data-fitted models, which suggest that the persistent sodium conductance has two different roles depending on its somatic versus dendritic location: perisomatic conductances could play a major role in maintaining action potential discharge and dendritic conductances would be more involved in other computational properties, such as those involving remote synaptic processing or bistable events.},

title = {Effect of simulated Ito on guinea pig and canine ventricular action potential morphology},
abstract = {The transient outward current (I(to)) is a major repolarizing current in the heart. Marked reduction of I(to) density occurs in heart failure and is accompanied by significant action potential duration (APD) prolongation. To understand the species-dependent role of I(to) in regulating the ventricular action potential morphology and duration, we introduced simulated I(to) conductance in guinea pig and canine endocardial ventricular myocytes using the dynamic clamp technique and perforated patch-clamp recordings. The effects of simulated I(to) in both types of cells were complex and biphasic, separated by a clear density threshold of approximately 40 pA/pF. Below this threshold, simulated I(to) resulted in a distinct phase 1 notch and had little effect on or moderately prolonged the APD. I(to) above the threshold resulted in all-or-none repolarization and precipitously reduced the APD. Qualitatively, these results agreed with our previous studies in canine ventricular cells using whole cell recordings. We conclude that 1) contrary to previous gene transfer studies involving the Kv4.3 current, the response of guinea pig ventricular myocytes to a fully inactivating I(to) is similar to that of canine ventricular cells and 2) in animals such as dogs that have a broad cardiac action potential, I(to) does not play a major role in setting the APD.},

abstract = {Cells that produce intrinsic theta oscillations often contain the hyperpolarization-activated current I(h). In this article, we use models and dynamic clamp experiments to investigate the synchronization properties of two such cells (stellate cells of the entorhinal cortex and O-LM cells of the hippocampus) in networks with fast-spiking (FS) interneurons. The model we use for stellate cells and O-LM cells is the same, but the stellate cells are excitatory and the O-LM cells are inhibitory, with inhibitory postsynaptic potential considerably longer than those from FS interneurons. We use spike time response curve methods (STRC), expanding that technique to three-cell networks and giving two different ways in which the analysis of the three-cell network reduces to that of a two-cell network. We show that adding FS cells to a network of stellate cells can desynchronize the stellate cells, while adding them to a network of O-LM cells can synchronize the O-LM cells. These synchronization and desynchronization properties critically depend on I(h). The analysis of the deterministic system allows us to understand some effects of noise on the phase relationships in the stellate networks. The dynamic clamp experiments use biophysical stellate cells and in silico FS cells, with connections that mimic excitation or inhibition, the latter with decay times associated with FS cells or O-LM cells. The results obtained in the dynamic clamp experiments are in a good agreement with the analytical framework.},

title = {Ion Channel Stochasticity May Be Critical in Determining the Reliability and Precision of Spike Timing},
abstract = {The firing reliability and precision of an isopotential membrane patch consisting of a realistically large number of ion channels is investigated using a stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model. In sharp contrast to the deterministic HH model, the biophysically inspired stochastic model re- produces qualitatively the different reliability and precision character- istics of spike firing in response to DC and fluctuating current input in neocortical neurons, as reported by Mainen {\&} Sejnowski (1995). For DC inputs, spike timing is highly unreliable; the reliability and precision are significantly increased for fluctuating current input. This behavior is crit- ically determined by the relatively small number of excitable channels that are opened near threshold for spike firing rather than by the total number of channels that exist in the membrane patch. Channel fluctu- ations, together with the inherent bistability in the HH equations, give rise to three additional experimentally observed phenomena: subthresh- old oscillations in the membrane voltage for DC input, ``spontaneous'' spikes for subthreshold inputs, and ``missing'' spikes for suprathreshold inputs. We suggest that the noise inherent in the operation of ion channels enables neurons to act as ``smart'' encoders. Slowly varying, uncorrelated inputs are coded with low reliability and accuracy and, hence, the in- formation about such inputs is encoded almost exclusively by the spike rate. On the other hand, correlated presynaptic activity produces sharp fluctuations in the input to the postsynaptic cell, which are then encoded with high reliability and accuracy. In this case, information about the input exists in the exact timing of the spikes. We conclude that channel stochasticity should be considered in realistic models of neurons},

abstract = {Biophysically detailed models of single cells are difficult to fit to real data. Recent advances in imaging techniques allow simultaneous access to various intracellular variables, and these data can be used to significantly facilitate the modelling task. These data, however, are noisy, and current approaches to building biophysically detailed models are not designed to deal with this. We extend previous techniques to take the noisy nature of the measurements into account. Sequential Monte Carlo (``particle filtering'') methods, in combination with a detailed biophysical description of a cell, are used for principled, model-based smoothing of noisy recording data. We also provide an alternative formulation of smoothing where the neural nonlinearities are estimated in a non-parametric manner. Biophysically important parameters of detailed models (such as channel densities, intercompartmental conductances, input resistances, and observation noise) are inferred automatically from noisy data via expectation-maximisation. Overall, we find that model-based smoothing is a powerful, robust technique for smoothing of noisy biophysical data and for inference of biophysical parameters in the face of recording noise.},

title = {StdpC: A modern dynamic clamp},
abstract = {With the advancement of computer technology many novel uses of dynamic clamp have become possible. We have added new features to our dynamic clamp software StdpC ("Spike timing-dependent plasticity Clamp") allowing such new applications while conserving the ease of use and installation of the popular earlier Dynclamp 2/4 package. Here, we introduce the new features of a waveform generator, freely programmable Hodgkin-Huxley conductances, learning synapses, graphic data displays, and a powerful scripting mechanism and discuss examples of experiments using these features. In the first example we built and 'voltage clamped' a conductance based model cell from a passive resistor-capacitor (RC) circuit using the dynamic clamp software to generate the voltage-dependent currents. In the second example we coupled our new spike generator through a burst detection/burst generation mechanism in a phase-dependent way to a neuron in a central pattern generator and dissected the subtle interaction between neurons, which seems to implement an information transfer through intraburst spike patterns. In the third example, making use of the new plasticity mechanism for simulated synapses, we analyzed the effect of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) on synchronization revealing considerable enhancement of the entrainment of a post-synaptic neuron by a periodic spike train. These examples illustrate that with modern dynamic clamp software like StdpC, the dynamic clamp has developed beyond the mere introduction of artificial synapses or ionic conductances into neurons to a universal research tool, which might well become a standard instrument of modern electrophysiology.},

abstract = {Neurons with the capacity to discharge at high rates-'fast-spiking' (FS) neurons-are critical participants in central motor and sensory circuits. It is widely accepted that K+ channels with Kv3.1 or Kv3.2 subunits underlie fast, delayed-rectifier (DR) currents that endow neurons with this FS ability. Expression of these subunits in heterologous systems, however, yields channels that open at more depolarized potentials than do native Kv3 family channels, suggesting that they differ. One possibility is that native channels incorporate a subunit that modifies gating. Molecular, electrophysiological and pharmacological studies reported here suggest that a splice variant of the Kv3.4 subunit coassembles with Kv3.1 subunits in rat brain FS neurons. Coassembly enhances the spike repolarizing efficiency of the channels, thereby reducing spike duration and enabling higher repetitive spike rates. These results suggest that manipulation of K3.4 subunit expression could be a useful means of controlling the dynamic range of FS neurons.},

Conceptually, the most important application is implementation of closed-loop electrical stimulation of intact and paralyzed subjects in the laboratory. Second, the system was tested in real-time muscle model identification procedure during a standing experiment. The plantarflexors of three nonimpaired subjects were excited with pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBSs) with small deviations around selected operating points. Electrically stimulated muscles were presented with a linear local dynamic block that was identified with a recursive least-square method (RARX). RARX block was designed with fundamental Matlab Simulink blocks that support real-time operation. Introduced was online estimation of model output, which offers a great manner of instant model validation. Two modes of operation with online validation were tested. In the first mode, the operating point for selected excitation level was identified online. In the second mode, the operating point was measured in preceding experiments. Both procedures resulted in satisfying second-order models that will be used in the adaptive controller design.},

title = {T-type calcium channels mediate rebound firing in intact deep cerebellar neurons},
abstract = {Neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) form the main output of the cerebellar circuitry and thus play an important role in cerebellar motor coordination. A prominent biophysical property observed in rat DCN neurons is rebound firing; a brief but strong hyperpolarizing input transiently increases their firing rate to much higher levels compared with that prior to the inhibitory input. Low-threshold T-type voltage-gated calcium channels have been suspected for a long time to be responsible for this phenomenon, but direct pharmacological evidence in support of this proposition is lacking. Even though a multitude of functional roles has been assigned to rebound firing in DCN neurons, their prevalence under physiological conditions is in question. Studies aimed at delineating the physiological role of rebound firing are hampered by the lack of a good pharmacological blocker. Here we show that mibefradil, a compound that blocks T-type calcium channels, potently blocks rebound firing in DCN neurons. In whole-cell experiments both mibefradil and NNC 55-0396 [(1S,2S)-2-(2-(N-[(3-benzimidazol-2-yl)propyl]-N-methylamino)ethyl)-6-fluoro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-isopropyl-2-naphtyl cyclopropanecarboxylate dihydrochloride]. a more selective T-type calcium channel blocker, effectively blocked rebound firing produced by direct current injection. Thus, mibefradil and other T-type channel modulators may prove to be invaluable tools for elucidating the functional importance of DCN rebound firing in cerebellar computation.},

title = {Control of neuronal firing by dynamic parallel fiber feedback: implications for electrosensory reafference suppression},
abstract = {The cancellation of self-generated components of sensory inputs is a key function of sensory feedback pathways. In many systems, cerebellar parallel fiber feedback mediates this cancellation through anti-Hebbian plasticity, resulting in the generation of a negative image of the reafferent inputs. Parallel fiber feedback involves direct excitation and disynaptic inhibition as well as synaptic plasticity on multiple time scales. How the dynamics of these processes interact with anti-Hebbian plasticity to shape synaptic inputs and provide a cancellation mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the influence of parallel fiber feedback onto pyramidal neurons of the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) in weakly electric fish under open loop conditions. We mimicked naturalistic parallel fiber inputs in an ELL brain slice by implementing an experimentally based model of this synaptic pathway using dynamic clamp. We showed that as parallel fiber activity increases, the effective input to ELL pyramidal neurons changes from net excitation to net inhibition, resulting in a non-monotonic firing response. Using a model neuron, we found that this robust non-monotonic response is due to a shift from balanced excitation and inhibition at low parallel fiber input rates, to dominant inhibition at high input rates. We then showed that this non-monotonic response provides a simple basis for negative image generation. Through changes in the mean activation rate of parallel fibers, the feedback can switch roles between enhancement and suppression of sensory inputs in a manner that is directly determined by the slope of the non-monotonic response curve.},

The amount of synaptic activity was much lower in brain slices (at 34 degrees C), as the standard deviation of the intracellular signal was 10-17 times lower in vitro than in vivo. Input resistances (Rins) measured in vivo during relatively quiescent epochs ("control Rins") could be reduced by up to 70% during periods of intense spontaneous activity. Further, the control Rins were increased by approximately 30-70% after TTX application in vivo, approaching in vitro values. In contrast, TTX produced negligible Rin changes in vitro (approximately 4%). These results indicate that, compared with the in vitro situation, the background synaptic activity present in intact networks dramatically reduces the electrical compactness of cortical neurons and modifies their integrative properties. The impact of the spontaneous synaptic bombardment should be taken into account when extrapolating in vitro findings to the intact brain.},

title = {Metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 regulates sodium currents in rat neocortical pyramidal neurons},
abstract = {Brain sodium channels (NaChs) are regulated by various neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, serotonin and dopamine. However, it is not known whether NaCh activity is regulated by glutamate, the principal brain neurotransmitter. We show here that activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) subtype 1 regulates fast transient (I-NaT) and persistent Na+ currents (I-NaP) in cortical pyramidal neurons. A selective agonist of group I mGluR, (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), reduced action potential amplitude and decreased I-NaT. This reduction was blocked when DHPG was applied in the presence of selective mGluR1 antagonists. The DHPG-induced reduction of the current was accompanied by a shift of both the inactivation curve of I-NaT and the activation curve of I-NaP. These effects were dependent on the activation of PKC. The respective role of these two regulatory processes on neuronal excitability was determined by simulating transient and persistent Na+ conductances (G(NaT) and G(NaP)) with fast dynamic-clamp techniques. The facilitated activation of G(NaP) increased excitability near the threshold, but, when combined with the down-regulation of G(NaT), repetitive firing was strongly decreased. Consistent with this finding, the mGluR1 antagonist LY367385 increased neuronal excitability when glutamatergic synaptic activity was stimulated with high external K+. We conclude that mGluR1-dependent regulation of Na+ current depresses neuronal excitability, which thus might constitute a novel mechanism of homeostatic regulation acting during intense glutamatergic synaptic activity.},

title = {Hormonal modulation of sensorimotor integration},
abstract = {Neuronal circuits commonly receive simultaneous inputs from descending, ascending, and hormonal systems. Thus far, however, most such inputs have been studied individually to determine their influence on a given circuit. Here, we examine the integrated action of the hormone crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) and the gastropyloric receptor (GPR) proprioceptor neuron on the biphasic gastric mill (chewing) rhythm driven by the projection neuron modulatory commissural neuron 1 (MCN1) in the isolated crab stomatogastric ganglion. In control saline, GPR stimulation selectively prolongs the gastric mill retractor phase, via presynaptic inhibition of MCN1. In the absence of GPR stimulation, CCAP does not alter retraction duration and modestly prolongs protraction. Here, we show, using computational modeling and dynamic-clamp manipulations, that the presence of CCAP weakens or eliminates the GPR effect on the gastric mill rhythm. This CCAP action results from its ability to activate the same modulator-activated conductance (G(MI)) as MCN1 in the gastric mill circuit neuron lateral gastric (LG). Because GPR prolongs retraction by weakening MCN1 activation of G(MI) in LG, the parallel G(MI) activation by CCAP reduces the impact of GPR regulation of this conductance. The CCAP-activated G(MI) thus counteracts the GPR-mediated decrease in the MCN1-activated G(MI) in LG and reduces the GPR ability to regulate the gastric mill rhythm. Consequently, although CCAP neither changes retraction duration nor alters GPR inhibition of MCN1, its activation of a modulator-activated conductance in a pivotal downstream circuit neuron enables CCAP to weaken or eliminate sensory regulation of motor circuit output.},

title = {Vasomotor sympathetic neurons are more excitable than secretomotor sympathetic neurons in bullfrog paravertebral ganglia},
abstract = {We compared the excitability of secretomotor B and vasomotor C neurons using virtual nicotinic synapses implemented with the dynamic clamp technique. In response to fast synaptic conductance (g(syn)) waveforms modeled after B cell synaptic currents, it took 17.1+/-1.2nS to elicit spikes in 104 B cells and 3.3+/-0.3nS in 35 C cells. After normalizing for whole-cell capacitance, C cells were still more excitable than B cells (76+/-5pS/pF vs. 169+/-8pS/pF). Stimulating C cells with slower g(syn) waveforms, identical to synaptic currents in C cells, further accentuated the difference between cell types. The phenotypic excitability difference did not correlate with time in culture (1-12days) and could not be explained by resting potential (B cells: -65.6+/-0.9mV, C cells: -63.1+/-1.6mV) or input conductance density, which was greater in C cells (24.4+/-4.3pS/pF) than B cells (14.5+/-1.5pS/pF). Action potentials elicited by virtual EPSPs had a threshold voltage for firing that was -28.4+/-0.7mV in C cells and -19.7+/-0.4mV B cells, and an upstroke velocity and peak spike potential that were greater in B cells. The repetitive firing properties of B and C cells were similar; 69-78% phasic, 11-16% adapting and 11-15% tonic. We propose that B and C neurons express different types of Na(+) channels that shape how they integrate nicotinic synaptic potentials.},

title = {Subthreshold outward currents enhance temporal integration in auditory neurons},
abstract = {Many auditory neurons possess low-threshold potassium currents (I-KLT) that enhance their responsiveness to rapid and coincident inputs. We present recordings from gerbil medial superior olivary (MSO) neurons in vitro and modeling results that illustrate how I-KLT improves the detection of brief signals, of weak signals in noise, and of the coincidence of signals (as needed for sound localization). We quantify the enhancing effect of I-KLT on temporal processing with several measures: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), reverse correlation or spike-triggered averaging of input currents, and interaural time difference (ITD) tuning curves. To characterize how I-KLT, which activates below spike threshold, influences a neuron's voltage rise toward threshold, i.e., how it filters the inputs, we focus first on the response to weak and noisy signals. Cells and models were stimulated with a computer-generated steady barrage of random inputs, mimicking weak synaptic conductance transients (the "noise"), together with a larger but still subthreshold postsynaptic conductance, EPSG (the "signal"). Reduction of I-KLT decreased the SNR, mainly due to an increase in spontaneous firing (more "false positive"). The spike-triggered reverse correlation indicated that I-KLT shortened the integration time for spike generation. I-KLT also heightened the model's timing selectivity for coincidence detection of simulated binaural inputs. Further, ITD tuning is shifted in favor of a slope code rather than a place code by precise and rapid inhibition onto MSO cells (Brand et al. 2002). In several ways, low-threshold outward currents are seen to shape integration of weak and strong signals in auditory neurons.},

title = {Efficient estimation of detailed single-neuron models},
abstract = {Biophysically accurate multicompartmental models of individual neurons have significantly advanced our understanding of the input-output function of single cells. These models depend on a large number of parameters that are difficult to estimate. In practice, they are often hand-tuned to match measured physiological behaviors, thus raising questions of identifiability and interpretability. We propose a statistical approach to the automatic estimation of various biologically relevant parameters, including 1) the distribution of channel densities, 2) the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic input, and 3) axial resistances across extended dendrites. Recent experimental advances, notably in voltage-sensitive imaging, motivate us to assume access to: i) the spatiotemporal voltage signal in the dendrite and ii) an approximate description of the channel kinetics of interest. We show here that, given i and ii, parameters 1-3 can be inferred simultaneously by nonnegative linear regression; that this optimization problem possesses a unique solution and is guaranteed to converge despite the large number of parameters and their complex nonlinear interaction; and that standard optimization algorithms efficiently reach this optimum with modest computational and data requirements. We demonstrate that the method leads to accurate estimations on a wide variety of challenging model data sets that include up to about 10(4) parameters (roughly two orders of magnitude more than previously feasible) and describe how the method gives insights into the functional interaction of groups of channels.},

title = {A novel multiple objective optimization framework for constraining conductance-based neuron models by experimental data},
abstract = {We present a novel framework for automatically constraining parameters of compartmental models of neurons, given a large set of experimentally measured responses of these neurons. In experiments, intrinsic noise gives rise to a large variability (e.g., in firing pattern) in the voltage responses to repetitions of the exact same input. Thus, the common approach of fitting models by attempting to perfectly replicate, point by point, a single chosen trace out of the spectrum of variable responses does not seem to do justice to the data. In addition, finding a single error function that faithfully characterizes the distance between two spiking traces is not a trivial pursuit. To address these issues, one can adopt a multiple objective optimization approach that allows the use of several error functions jointly. When more than one error function is available, the comparison between experimental voltage traces and model response can be performed on the basis of individual features of interest (e.g., spike rate, spike width). Each feature can be compared between model and experimental mean, in units of its experimental variability, thereby incorporating into the fitting this variability. We demonstrate the success of this approach, when used in conjunction with genetic algorithm optimization, in generating an excellent fit between model behavior and the firing pattern of two distinct electrical classes of cortical interneurons, accommodating and fast-spiking. We argue that the multiple, diverse models generated by this method could serve as the building blocks for the realistic simulation of large neuronal networks.},

Here, we show that two types of inhibitory neurons in the cerebellar cortex fire spontaneously and regularly in the absence of synaptic input but generate an irregular firing pattern in the presence of tonic synaptic inhibition. Paired recordings between synaptically connected neurons revealed that single action potentials in inhibitory interneurons cause highly variable delays in action potential firing in their postsynaptic cells. Activity in single and multiple inhibitory interneurons also significantly reduces postsynaptic membrane time constant and input resistance. These findings suggest that the time window for synaptic integration is a dynamic variable modulated by the level of tonic inhibition, and that rate coding and temporal coding strategies may be used in parallel in the same cell type.},

abstract = {The cerebellar nuclei integrate inhibitory input from Purkinje cells with excitatory input from mossy and climbing fiber collaterals and are the sole cerebellar output. Numerous studies have shown that the cerebellar cortex is highly compartmentalized into hundreds of genetically determined, reproducible topographic units--transverse zones and parasagittal stripes--that can be identified through the expression patterns of numerous molecules. The Purkinje cell stripes project to the cerebellar nuclei. However, there is no known commensurate topographic complexity in the cerebellar nuclei. Rather, conventional anatomical descriptions identify four major subdivisions--the medial, anterior and posterior interposed, and lateral nuclei--together with a few intranuclear subdivisions. To begin to address the apparent complexity gap, we have used a panel of antigens and transgenes to reveal a reproducible molecular heterogeneity in the mouse cerebellar nuclei. Based on the differential expression patterns, singly and in combination, a new cerebellar nuclear topographic map has been constructed. This reveals the subdivision of the cerebellar nuclei into at least 12 reproducible expression domains. We hypothesize that such heterogeneity is the counterpart of the zones and stripes of the cerebellar cortex.},

title = {Proprioceptor regulation of motor circuit activity by presynaptic inhibition of a modulatory projection neuron},
abstract = {Phasically active sensory systems commonly influence rhythmic motor activity via synaptic actions on the relevant circuit and/or motor neurons. Using the crab stomatogastric nervous system (STNS), we identified a distinct synaptic action by which an identified proprioceptor, the gastropyloric muscle stretch receptor(GPR) neuron, regulates the gastric mill( chewing) motorrhythm. Previous work showed that rhythmically stimulating GPR in a gastric mill-like pattern, in the isolated STNS, elicits the gastric mill rhythm via its activation of two identified projection neurons, modulatory commissural neuron 1 (MCN1) and commissural projection neuron 2, in the commissural ganglia. Here, we determine how activation of GPR with a behaviorally appropriate pattern ( active during each gastric mill retractor phase) influences an ongoing gastric mill rhythm via actions in the stomatogastric ganglion, where the gastric mill circuit is located. Stimulating GPR during each retractor phase selectively prolongs that phase and thereby slows the ongoing rhythm. This selective action on the retractor phase results from two distinct GPR actions. First, GPR presynaptically inhibits the axon terminals of MCN1, reducing MCN1 excitation of all gastric mill neurons. Second, GPR directly excites the retractor phase neurons. Because MCN1 transmitter release occurs during each retractor phase, these parallel GPR actions selectively reduce the buildup of excitatory drive to the protractor phase neurons, delaying each protractor burst. Thus, rhythmic proprioceptor feedback to a motor circuit can result from a global reduction in excitatory drive to that circuit, via presynaptic inhibition, coupled with a phase-specific excitatory input that prolongs the excited phase by delaying the onset of the subsequent phase.},

title = {Unitary IPSPs enhance hilar mossy cell gain in the rat hippocampus},
abstract = {Mechanisms that control neuronal gain allow for adaptive rescaling to synaptic inputs of varying strengths or frequencies. Here, we show that unitary IPSPs (uIPSPs) modulate gain and unitary EPSP (uEPSP)-action potential coupling in mossy cells (MCs) from rat hippocampal slices. Mossy fibre-evoked uEPSCs were large, facilitated and were suppressed by the group II metabotropic glutamate agonist LY354740. Conversely, uIPSCs were smaller, depressed and were not affected by LY354740, but exerted strong inhibitory control over uEPSP-action potential coupling. The IPSC reversal potential was determined by gramicidin perforated patch recordings to be -65.3 +/- 5.0 mV, lying between the resting membrane potential (-75.3 +/- 1.1 mV) and the action potential threshold (-56.5 +/- 2.4 mV). When applied at theta frequency (10 Hz), uIPSPs increased the offset of the MC input-output response to depolarizing current injection, but also increased gain, maximal firing rate and the slope of the depolarization preceding action potentials. These effects were unchanged by the Ca2+ and HCN channel blockers mibefradil and ZD7288, respectively. The height and maximal slope of MC action potentials during tonic depolarization were also increased by uIPSPs, and the decay of uIPSP conductances injected by dynamic clamp at subthreshold membrane potentials was prolonged by TTX. Application of the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine mimicked the effect of IPSPs on MC maximal firing rate, and action potential height and slope, and this was reversed by the GABA(A) antagonist gabazine. Thus, uIPSPs can increase neuronal gain under hyperexcitable conditions, and this effect is probably due to the de-inactivation of a TTX-sensitive voltage-dependent Na+ conductance.},

title = {Gain control in CA1 pyramidal cells using changes in somatic conductance},
abstract = {Gain modulation is an important feature of neural activity. Previous work has focused on the ability of background synaptic noise to modulate the slope (i.e., gain) of the frequency-current (f-I) relationship in neurons. To date, demonstrations of gain control that are independent of synaptic noise have been limited. We investigated the effects of increasing somatic conductance in the form of tonic inhibition on the initial and steady-state f-I relationship of CA1 pyramidal cells. We find that increasing membrane conductance reduces the gain of the steady-state f-I relationship through a graded increase in the magnitude of spike frequency adaptation. Increased adaptation arises through a conductance-induced depolarization of spike voltage threshold. Thus, by increasing the magnitude of spike frequency adaptation, added conductance can reduce the gain of the steady-state f-I relationship in the absence of random background membrane fluctuations.},

title = {Patterns and pauses in Purkinje cell simple spike trains: experiments, modeling and theory},
abstract = {We review our recent experimental and modeling results on how cerebellar Purkinje cells encode information in their simple spike trains and present a theory of the function of pauses and regular spiking patterns. The regular spiking patterns were discovered in extracellular recordings of simple spikes in awake and anesthetized rodents, where it was shown that more than half of the spontaneous activity consists of short epochs of regular spiking. These periods of regular spiking are interrupted by pauses, which can be tightly synchronized among nearby Purkinje cells, while the spikes in the regular patterns are not. Interestingly, pauses are affected by long-term depression of the parallel fiber synapses. Both in modeling and slice experiments it was demonstrated that long-term depression causes a decrease in the duration of pauses, leading to an increase of the spike output of the neuron. Based on these results we propose that pauses in the simple spike train form a temporal code which can lead to a rebound burst in the target deep cerebellar nucleus neurons. Conversely, the regular spike patterns may be a rate code, which presets the amplitude of future rebound bursts.},

title = {Different levels of Ih determine distinct temporal integration in bursting and regular-spiking neurons in rat subiculum},
abstract = {Pyramidal neurons in the subiculum typically display either bursting or regular-spiking behaviour. Although this classification into two neuronal classes is well described, it is unknown how these two classes of neurons contribute to the integration of input to the subiculum. Here, we report that bursting neurons possess a hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I(h)) that is two-fold larger (conductance, 5.3 +/- 0.5 nS) than in regular-spiking neurons (2.2 +/- 0.6 nS), whereas I(h) exhibits similar voltage-dependent and kinetic properties in both classes of neurons. Bursting and regular-spiking neurons display similar morphology. The difference in I(h) between the two classes of neurons is not responsible for the distinct firing patterns, as neither pharmacological blockade of I(h) nor enhancement of I(h) using a dynamic clamp affects the qualitative firing patterns. Instead, the difference in I(h) between bursting and regular-spiking neurons determines the temporal integration of evoked synaptic input from the CA1 area. In response to stimulation at 50 Hz, bursting neurons, with a large I(h), show approximately 50% less temporal summation than regular-spiking neurons. The amount of temporal summation in both neuronal classes is equal after pharmacological blockade of I(h). A computer simulation model of a subicular neuron with the properties of either a bursting or a regular-spiking neuron confirmed the pivotal role of I(h) in temporal integration of synaptic input. These data suggest that in the subicular network, bursting neurons are better suited to discriminate the content of high-frequency input, such as that occurring during gamma oscillations, than regular-spiking neurons.},

abstract = {Neurons and dynamical models of spike generation display two different classes of threshold behavior: type 1 [firing frequency vs. current (f-I) relationship is continuous at threshold] and type 2 (discontinuous f-I). With steady current or conductance stimulation, regular-spiking (RS) pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons in layer 2/3 of somatosensory cortex exhibit type 1 and type 2 threshold behaviors, respectively. We compared the postsynaptic firing variability of type 1 RS and type 2 FS cells, during naturalistic, fluctuating conductance input. In RS neurons, increasing the level of independently random, shunting inhibition caused a monotonic increase in spike reliability, whereas in FS interneurons, there was an optimum level of shunting inhibition for achieving the most reliable spike generation and the most precise spike-time encoding. This was observed over a range of different degrees of synchrony, or correlation, in the input. RS cells displayed a progressive rise in spike jitter during natural-like transient burst inputs, whereas for FS cells, jitter was mostly kept low. Furthermore, RS cells showed encoding of the input level in the spike shape, whereas FS cells did not. These differences between the two cell types are consistent with a role of RS neurons as rate-coding integrators, and a role of FS neurons as resonators controlling the coherence of synchronous firing.},

title = {Sound stimulation modulates high-threshold K(+) currents in mouse auditory brainstem neurons},
abstract = {The auditory system provides a valuable experimental model to investigate the role of sensory activity in regulating neuronal membrane properties. In this study, we have investigated the role of activity directly by measuring changes in medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) neurons in normal hearing mice subjected to 1-h sound stimulation. Broadband (4-12 kHz) chirps were used to activate MNTB neurons tonotopically restricted to the lateral MNTB, as confirmed by c-Fos-immunoreactivity. Following 1-h sound stimulation a substantial increase in Kv3.1b-immunoreactivity was measured in the lateral region of the MNTB, which lasted for 2 h before returning to control levels. Electrophysiological patch-clamp recordings in brainstem slices revealed an increase in high-threshold potassium currents in the lateral MNTB of sound-stimulated mice. Current-clamp and dynamic-clamp experiments showed that MNTB cells from the sound-stimulated mice were able to maintain briefer action potentials during high-frequency firing than cells from control mice. These results provide evidence that acoustically driven auditory activity can selectively regulate high-threshold potassium currents in the MNTB of normal hearing mice, likely due to an increased membrane expression of Kv3.1b channels.},

title = {In vitro and in vivo measures of evoked excitatory and inhibitory conductance dynamics in sensory cortices},
abstract = {In order to better understand the synaptic nature of the integration process operated by cortical neurons during sensory processing, it is necessary to devise quantitative methods which allow one to infer the level of conductance change evoked by the sensory stimulation and, consequently, the dynamics of the balance between excitation and inhibition. Such detailed measurements are required to characterize the static versus dynamic nature of the non-linear interactions triggered at the single cell level by sensory stimulus. This paper primarily reviews experimental data from our laboratory based on direct conductance measurements during whole-cell patch clamp recordings in two experimental preparations: (1) in vitro, during electrical stimulation in the visual cortex of the rat and (2) in vivo, during visual stimulation, in the primary visual cortex of the anaesthetized cat. Both studies demonstrate that shunting inhibition is expressed as well in vivo as in vitro. Our in vivo data reveals that a high level of diversity is observed in the degree of interaction (from linear to non-linear) and in the temporal interplay (from push-pull to synchronous) between stimulus-driven excitation (E) and inhibition (I). A detailed analysis of the E/I balance during evoked spike activity further shows that the firing strength results from a simultaneous decrease of evoked inhibition and increase of excitation. Secondary, the paper overviews the various computational methods used in the literature to assess conductance dynamics, measured in current clamp as well as in voltage clamp in different neocortical areas and species, and discuss the consistency of their estimations.},

title = {Simulation and parameter estimation study of a simple neuronal model of rhythm generation: role of NMDA and non-NMDA receptors},
abstract = {Simple neural network models of the Xenopus embryo swimming CPG, based on the one originally developed by Roberts and Tunstall (1990), were used to investigate the role of the voltage-dependent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channels, in conjunction with faster non-NMDA components of synaptic excitation, in rhythm generation. The voltage-dependent NMDA current "follows" the membrane potential, leading to a postinhibitory rebound that is more efficient than one without voltage dependency and allows neurons to fire more than one action potential per cycle. Furthermore, the model demonstrated limited rhythmic activity in the absence of synaptic inhibition, supporting the hypothesis that the NMDA channels provide a basic mechanism for rhythmicity. However, the rhythmic properties induced by the NMDA current were observed only when there was moderate activation of the non-NMDA synaptic channels, suggesting a modulatory role for this component. The simulations also show that the voltage dependency of the NMDA conductance, as well as the fast non-NMDA current, stabilizes the alternation pattern versus synchrony. To verify that these effects and their implications on the mechanism of swimming and transition to other types of activity take place in the real preparation, constraints on parameter values have to be specified. A method to estimate synaptic parameters was tested with generated data. It is shown that a global analysis, based on multiple iterations of the optimization process (Foster et al., 1993), gives a better understanding of the parameter subspace describing network activity than a standard fit with a sensitivity analysis for an individual solution.},

While neuronal simulators such as NEURON, GENESIS, MOOSE, NEST, and PSICS facilitate the development of these data-driven neuronal models, the specialized languages they employ are generally not interoperable, limiting model accessibility and preventing reuse of model components and cross-simulator validation. To overcome these problems we have used an Open Source software approach to develop NeuroML, a neuronal model description language based on XML (Extensible Markup Language). This enables these detailed models and their components to be defined in a standalone form, allowing them to be used across multiple simulators and archived in a standardized format. Here we describe the structure of NeuroML and demonstrate its scope by converting into NeuroML models of a number of different voltage- and ligand-gated conductances, models of electrical coupling, synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity, together with morphologically detailed models of individual neurons. We have also used these NeuroML-based components to develop an highly detailed cortical network model. NeuroML-based model descriptions were validated by demonstrating similar model behavior across five independently developed simulators. Although our results confirm that simulations run on different simulators converge, they reveal limits to model interoperability, by showing that for some models convergence only occurs at high levels of spatial and temporal discretisation, when the computational overhead is high. Our development of NeuroML as a common description language for biophysically detailed neuronal and network models enables interoperability across multiple simulation environments, thereby improving model transparency, accessibility and reuse in computational neuroscience.},

title = {Parameter and state estimation of experimental chaotic systems using synchronization},
abstract = {We examine the use of synchronization as a mechanism for extracting parameter and state information from experimental systems. We focus on important aspects of this problem that have received little attention previously and we explore them using experiments and simulations with the chaotic Colpitts oscillator as an example system. We explore the impact of model imperfection on the ability to extract valid information from an experimental system. We compare two optimization methods: an initial value method and a constrained method. Each of these involves coupling the model equations to the experimental data in order to regularize the chaotic motions on the synchronization manifold. We explore both time-dependent and time-independent coupling and discuss the use of periodic impulse coupling. We also examine both optimized and fixed (or manually adjusted) coupling. For the case of an optimized time-dependent coupling function u(t) we find a robust structure which includes sharp peaks and intervals where it is zero. This structure shows a strong correlation with the location in phase space and appears to depend on noise, imperfections of the model, and the Lyapunov direction vectors. For time-independent coupling we find the counterintuitive result that often the optimal rms error in fitting the model to the data initially increases with coupling strength. Comparison of this result with that obtained using simulated data may provide one measure of model imperfection. The constrained method with time-dependent coupling appears to have benefits in synchronizing long data sets with minimal impact, while the initial value method with time-independent coupling tends to be substantially faster, more flexible, and easier to use. We also describe a method of coupling which is useful for sparse experimental data sets. Our use of the Colpitts oscillator allows us to explore in detail the case of a system with one positive Lyapunov exponent. The methods we explored are easily extended to driven systems such as neurons with time-dependent injected current. They are expected to be of value in nonchaotic systems as well.

title = {The role of K+ currents in frequency-dependent spike broadening in Aplysia R20 neurons: a dynamic-clamp analysis},
abstract = {The R20 neurons of Aplysia exhibit frequency-dependent spike broadening. Previously, we had used two-electrode voltage clamp to examine the mechanisms of this spike broadening (Ma and Koester, 1995). We identified three K+ currents that mediate action-potential repolarization: a transient A-type K+ current (I(Adepol)), a delayed rectifier current (IK-V), and a Ca(2+)-sensitive K+ current(IK-CA). A major constraint in that study was the lack of completely selective blockers for I(Adepol) and I(K-V), resulting in an inability to assess directly the effects of their activation and inactivation on spike broadening. In the present study, the dynamic-clamp technique, which employs computer simulation to inject biologically realistic currents into a cell under current-clamp conditions (Sharp et al., 1993a,b), was used either to block I(Adepol) or I(K-V) or to modify their inactivation properties. The data in this paper, together with earlier results, lead to the following hypothesis for the mechanism of spike broadening in the R20 cells. As the spike train progresses, the primary responsibility for spike repolarization gradually shifts from I(Adepol) to I(K-V) to I(K-Ca). This sequence can be explained on the basis of the relative rates of activation and inactivation of each current with respect to the constantly changing spike durations, the cumulative inactivation of I(Adepol) and I(K-V), and the progressive potentiation of I(K-Ca). Positive feedback interactions between spike broadening and inactivation contribute to the cumulative inactivation of both I(Adepol) and I(K-V). The data also illustrate that when two or more currents have similar driving forces and partially overlapping activation characteristics, selectively blocking one current under current-clamp conditions can lead to a significant underestimate of its normal physiological importance.},

title = {Visual input evokes transient and strong shunting inhibition in visual cortical neurons},
abstract = {The function and nature of inhibition of neurons in the visual cortex have been the focus of both experimental and theoretical investigations. There are two ways in which inhibition can suppress synaptic excitation. In hyperpolarizing inhibition, negative and positive currents sum linearly to produce a net change in membrane potential. In contrast, shunting inhibition acts nonlinearly by causing an increase in membrane conductance; this divides the amplitude of the excitatory response. Visually evoked changes in membrane conductance have been reported to be nonsignificant or weak, supporting the hyperpolarization mode of inhibition. Here we present a new approach to studying inhibition that is based on in vivo whole-cell voltage clamping. This technique allows the continuous measurement of conductance dynamics during visual activation. We show, in neurons of cat primary visual cortex, that the response to optimally orientated flashed bars can increase the somatic input conductance to more than three times that of the resting state. The short latency of the visually evoked peak of conductance, and its apparent reversal potential suggest a dominant contribution from gamma-aminobutyric acid ((GABA)A) receptor-mediated synapses. We propose that nonlinear shunting inhibition may act during the initial stage of visual cortical processing, setting the balance between opponent 'On' and 'Off' responses in different locations of the visual receptive field.},

title = {Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus type 2 mutation W1204R alters voltage-dependent gating of Na(v)1.1 sodium channels},
abstract = {Nine mutations that cause generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus have been identified in the SCN1A gene encoding the a subunit of the Na(v)1.1 voltage-gated sodium channel. The functional properties of two of these mutations (T875M and R1648H) have previously been described. T875M was shown to enhance slow inactivation, while R1648H dramatically accelerated recovery from inactivation. In this report, we have cloned, expressed and characterized the functional effects of a third generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus mutation, W1204R (Am J Hum Genet 68 (2001) 866). The mutation was cloned into the orthologous rat channel, rNa(v)1.1, and at the same time a single base pair insertion at base 120 in the original rNa(v)1.1 clone was corrected. The level of expression of the corrected wildtype rNa(v)1.1 was approximately 1000-fold higher than that of the original clone and comparable to that achieved with other neuronal sodium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The properties of the W1204R mutant in the corrected rNa(v)1.1 were determined in the absence and presence of the 131 subunit in Xenopus oocytes. The W1204R mutation resulted in approximately 11 mV hyperpolarized shifts in the voltage-dependence of activation and steady-state inactivation when expressed as an alpha subunit alone. When the channels were coexpressed with the beta1 subunit, the hyperpolarized shifts were still present but smaller, approximately 5 mV in magnitude. All other properties that we examined were comparable for the mutant and wild-type channels. The negative shift in activation would increase channel excitability, whereas the negative shift in inactivation would decrease excitability. The negative shifts in both properties also shifted the window current, which is the voltage region in which sodium channels can continue to open because some percentage of channels are activated and not all of the channels are inactivated. The shift in window current for the W1204R mutation could result in hyperexcitability because the neuron's potential is more likely to reach the more negative range. These results demonstrate that a third SCN1A mutation that causes generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus 2 alters the properties of the sodium channel in a different manner than the previous two mutations that were studied. The diversity in functional effects for these three mutations indicates that a similar clinical phenotype can result from very different underlying sodium channel abnormalities. (C) 2003 IBRO.

title = {Regulation of Persistent Na Current by Interactions between beta Subunits of Voltage-Gated Na Channels},
abstract = {The beta subunits of voltage-gated Na channels (Scnxb) regulate the gating of pore-forming alpha subunits, as well as their trafficking and localization. In heterologous expression systems, beta 1, beta 2, and beta 3 subunits influence inactivation and persistent current in different ways. To test how the beta 4 protein regulates Na channel gating, we transfected beta 4 into HEK (human embryonic kidney) cells stably expressing Na(V)1.1. Unlike a free peptide with a sequence from the beta 4 cytoplasmic domain, the full-length beta 4 protein did not block open channels. Instead, beta 4 expression favored open states by shifting activation curves negative, decreasing the slope of the inactivation curve, and increasing the percentage of noninactivating current. Consequently, persistent current tripled in amplitude. Expression of beta 1 or chimeric subunits including the beta 1 extracellular domain, however, favored inactivation. Coexpressing Na(V)1.1 and beta 4 with beta 1 produced tiny persistent currents, indicating that beta 1 overcomes the effects of beta 4 in heterotrimeric channels. In contrast, beta 1(C121W), which contains an extracellular epilepsy-associated mutation, did not counteract the destabilization of inactivation by beta 4 and also required unusually large depolarizations for channel opening. In cultured hippocampal neurons transfected with beta 4, persistent current was slightly but significantly increased. Moreover, in beta 4-expressing neurons from Scn1b and Scn1b/Scn2b null mice, entry into inactivated states was slowed. These data suggest that beta 1 and beta 4 have antagonistic roles, the former favoring inactivation, and the latter favoring activation. Because increased Na channel availability may facilitate action potential firing, these results suggest a mechanism for seizure susceptibility of both mice and humans with disrupted beta 1 subunits.},

title = {Inhibition of interneuron firing extends the spread of endocannabinoid signaling in the cerebellum},
abstract = {Endocannabinoids serve as retrograde messengers in many brain regions. These diffusible lipophilic molecules are released by postsynaptic cells and regulate presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Here we describe an additional mechanism that mediates the spread of endocannabinoid signaling to distant inhibitory synapses. Depolarization of cerebellar Purkinje cells reduced the firing rate of nearby interneurons, and this reduction in firing was blocked by the cannabinoid receptor antagonist AM251. The cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 also reduced firing rates in interneurons, and this inhibition arose from the activation of a small potassium conductance. Thus, endocannabinoids released from the dendrites of depolarized neurons can lead to inhibition of firing in nearby cells. Because interneurons can project over several hundred micrometers, this inhibition of firing allows cells to regulate synaptic inputs at distances well beyond the limits of endocannabinoid diffusion.},

title = {The what and where of adding channel noise to the Hodgkin-Huxley  equations},
abstract = { One of the most celebrated successes in computational biology is the Hodgkin-Huxley framework for modeling electrically active cells. This framework, expressed through a set of differential equations, synthesizes the impact of ionic currents on a cell's voltage - and the highly nonlinear impact of that voltage back on the currents themselves - into the rapid push and pull of the action potential. Latter studies confirmed that these cellular dynamics are orchestrated by individual ion channels, whose conformational changes regulate the conductance of each ionic current. Thus, kinetic equations familiar from physical chemistry are the natural setting for describing conductances; for small-to-moderate numbers of channels, these will predict fluctuations in conductances and stochasticity in the resulting action potentials. At first glance, the kinetic equations provide a far more complex (and higher-dimensional) description than the original Hodgkin-Huxley equations. This has prompted more than a decade of efforts to capture channel fluctuations with noise terms added to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. Many of these approaches, while intuitively appealing, produce quantitative errors when compared to kinetic equations; others, as only very recently demonstrated, are both accurate and relatively simple. We review what works, what doesn't, and why, seeking to build a bridge to well-established results for the deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley equations. As such, we hope that this review will speed emerging studies of how channel noise modulates electrophysiological dynamics and function. We supply user-friendly Matlab simulation code of these stochastic versions of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations on the ModelDB website (accession number 138950) and http://www.amath.washington.edu/~etsb/tutorials.html. },

title = {Synaptic shot noise and conductance fluctuations affect the membrane voltage with equal significance},
abstract = {The subthreshold membrane voltage of a neuron in active cortical tissue is a fluctuating quantity with a distribution that reflects the firing statistics of the presynaptic population. It was recently found that conductance-based synaptic drive can lead to distributions with a significant skew. Here it is demonstrated that the underlying shot noise caused by Poissonian spike arrival also skews the membrane distribution, but in the opposite sense. Using a perturbative method, we analyze the effects of shot noise on the distribution of synaptic conductances and calculate the consequent voltage distribution. To first order in the perturbation theory, the voltage distribution is a gaussian modulated by a prefactor that captures the skew. The gaussian component is identical to distributions derived using current-based models with an effective membrane time constant. The well-known effective-time-constant approximation can therefore be identified as the leading-order solution to the full conductance-based model. The higher-order modulatory prefactor containing the skew comprises terms due to both shot noise and conductance fluctuations. The diffusion approximation misses these shot-noise effects implying that analytical approaches such as the Fokker-Planck equation or simulation with filtered white noise cannot be used to improve on the gaussian approximation. It is further demonstrated that quantities used for fitting theory to experiment, such as the voltage mean and variance, are robust against these non-Gaussian effects. The effective-time-constant approximation is therefore relevant to experiment and provides a simple analytic base on which other pertinent biological details may be added.},

title = {Alternative to hand-tuning conductance-based models: construction and analysis of databases of model neurons},
abstract = {Conventionally, the parameters of neuronal models are hand-tuned using trial-and-error searches to produce a desired behavior. Here, we present an alternative approach. We have generated a database of about 1.7 million single-compartment model neurons by independently varying 8 maximal membrane conductances based on measurements from lobster stomatogastric neurons. We classified the spontaneous electrical activity of each model neuron and its responsiveness to inputs during runtime with an adaptive algorithm and saved a reduced version of each neuron's activity pattern. Our analysis of the distribution of different activity types (silent, spiking, bursting, irregular) in the 8-dimensional conductance space indicates that the coarse grid of conductance values we chose is sufficient to capture the salient features of the distribution. The database can be searched for different combinations of neuron properties such as activity type, spike or burst frequency, resting potential, frequency-current relation, and phase-response curve. We demonstrate how the database can be screened for models that reproduce the behavior of a specific biological neuron and show that the contents of the database can give insight into the way a neuron's membrane conductances determine its activity pattern and response properties. Similar databases can be constructed to explore parameter spaces in multicompartmental models or small networks, or to examine the effects of changes in the voltage dependence of currents. In all cases, database searches can provide insight into how neuronal and network properties depend on the values of the parameters in the models.},

title = {What causes a neuron to spike?},
abstract = {The computation performed by a neuron can be formulated as a combination of dimensional reduction in stimulus space and the nonlinearity inherent in a spiking output. White noise stimulus and reverse correlation (the spike-triggered average and spike-triggered covariance) are often used in experimental neuroscience to "ask" neurons which dimensions in stimulus space they are sensitive to and to characterize the nonlinearity of the response. In this article, we apply reverse correlation to the simplest model neuron with temporal dynamics-the leaky integrate-and-fire model-and find that for even this simple case, standard techniques do not recover the known neural computation. To overcome this, we develop novel reverse-correlation techniques by selectively analyzing only "isolated" spikes and taking explicit account of the extended silences that precede these isolated spikes. We discuss the implications of our methods to the characterization of neural adaptation. Although these methods are developed in the context of the leaky integrate-and-fire model, our findings are relevant for the analysis of spike trains from real neurons.},

title = {Enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio and phase locking for small inputs by a low-threshold outward current in auditory neurons},
abstract = {Neurons possess multiple voltage-dependent conductances specific for their function. To investigate how low-threshold outward currents improve the detection of small signals in a noisy background, we recorded from gerbil medial superior olivary (MSO) neurons in vitro. MSO neurons responded phasically, with a single spike to a step current injection. When bathed in dendrotoxin (DTX), most cells switched to tonic firing, suggesting that low-threshold potassium currents (I-KLT) participated in shaping these phasic responses. Neurons were stimulated with a computer-generated steady barrage of random inputs, mimicking weak synaptic conductance transients (the "noise"), together with a larger but still subthreshold postsynaptic conductance, EPSG (the "signal"). DTX reduced the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), defined as the ratio of probability to fire in response to the EPSG and the probability to fire spontaneously in response to noise. The reduction was mainly attributable to the increase of spontaneous firing in DTX The spike-triggered reverse correlation indicated that, for spike generation, the neuron with I-KT required faster inward current transients. This narrow temporal integration window contributed to superior phase locking of firing to periodic stimuli before application of DTX A computer model including Hodgkin-Huxley type conductances for spike generation and for I,,T (Rathouz and Trussell, 1998) showed similar response statistics. The dynamic low-threshold outward current increased SNR and the temporal precision of integration of Weak subthreshold signals in auditory neurons by suppressing false positives.},

title = {Enhancement of excitatory synaptic integration by GABAergic inhibition in the subthalamic nucleus},
abstract = {The activity patterns of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons, which are intimately related to normal movement and abnormal movement in Parkinson's disease (PD), are sculpted by feedback GABAergic inhibition from the reciprocally connected globus pallidus (GP). To understand the principles underlying the integration of GABAergic inputs, we used gramicidin-based patch-clamp recording of STN neurons in rat brain slices. Voltage-dependent Na+ (Nav) channels actively truncated synthetic IPSPs and were required for autonomous activity. In contrast, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated and class 3 voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels contributed minimally to the integration of single or low-frequency trains of IPSPs and autonomous activity. Interestingly, IPSPs modified action potentials (APs) in a manner that suggested IPSPs enhanced postsynaptic Nav channel availability. This possibility was confirmed in acutely isolated STN neurons using current-clamp recordings containing IPSPs as voltage-clamp waveforms. Tetrodotoxin-sensitive subthreshold and spike-associated Na+ currents declined during autonomous spiking but were indeed transiently boosted after IPSPs. A functional consequence of inhibition-dependent augmentation of postsynaptic excitability was that EPSP-AP coupling was dramatically improved when IPSPs preceded EPSPs. Because STN neuronal activity exhibits coherence with cortical beta-oscillations in PD, we tested how rhythmic sequences of cortical EPSPs were integrated in the absence and presence of feedback inhibition. STN neuronal activity was consistently entrained by EPSPs only in the presence of feedback inhibition. These observations suggest that feedback inhibition from the GP is critical for the emergence of coherent beta-oscillations between the cortex and STN in PD.},

title = {Activation of intrinsic and synaptic currents in leech heart interneurons by realistic waveforms},
abstract = {Leech heart interneurons were voltage-clamped with realistic waveforms to investigate the currents underlying the oscillation in the cells. By estimating the leak current parameters in regions in which there was little contamination by voltage-gated currents, it was possible to measure the Ca2+ current, the persistent Na+ current, Ip, and the hyperpolarization-activated inward current, Ih. The experiments verified a prediction of a computer model of HN cells that the shape of the typical waveform was such that the low-threshold Ca2+ currents were partially inactivated during a slow up-ramp to a plateau potential. A step within the same range of the membrane potential as the realistic waveform produced > 4 times as much Ca2+ current. In two-cell voltage-clamp experiments, the step produced 20 times more graded inhibition than the normal presynaptic waveform. When the presynaptic heart interneuron oscillated with spikes, the graded inhibition was larger. The difference may arise from integration of a slowly decaying component of the spike-mediated inhibition. The persistent Na+ current had a very low threshold. During the most hyperpolarized phase of the waveform, Ip deactivated to 50% of its maximum conductance. A substantial part of Ip, therefore, was effectively contributing to the leak current in the HN cells. The h-current increased for waveforms that had longer periods, whereas increasing the h-current in the model reduced the period. The h-current thus provides negative feedback to perturbations that alter the period of the oscillation.},

title = {On stochastic differential equation models for ion channel noise in  Hodgkin-Huxley neurons},
abstract = { The random transitions of ion channels between conducting and non-conducting states generate a source of internal fluctuations in a neuron, known as channel noise. The standard method for modeling fluctuations in the states of ion channels uses continuous-time Markov chains nonlinearly coupled to a differential equation for voltage. Beginning with the work of Fox and Lu, there have been attempts to generate simpler models that use stochastic differential equation (SDEs) to approximate the stochastic spiking activity produced by Markov chain models. Recent numerical investigations, however, have raised doubts that SDE models can preserve the stochastic dynamics of Markov chain models.  We analyze three SDE models that have been proposed as approximations to the Markov chain model: one that describes the states of the ion channels and two that describe the states of the ion channel subunits. We show that the former channel-based approach can capture the distribution of channel noise and its effect on spiking in a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model to a degree not previously demonstrated, but the latter two subunit-based approaches cannot. Our analysis provides intuitive and mathematical explanations for why this is the case: the temporal correlation in the channel noise is determined by the combinatorics of bundling subunits into channels, and the subunit-based approaches do not correctly account for this structure. Our study therefore confirms and elucidates the findings of previous numerical investigations of subunit-based SDE models. Moreover, it presents the first evidence that Markov chain models of the nonlinear, stochastic dynamics of neural membranes can be accurately approximated by SDEs. This finding opens a door to future modeling work using SDE techniques to further illuminate the effects of ion channel fluctuations on electrically active cells. },

title = {Efficient data assimilation for spatiotemporal chaos: A local ensemble transform Kalman filter},
abstract = {Data assimilation is an iterative approach to the problem of estimating the state of a dynamical system using both current and past observations of the system together with a model for the system's time evolution. Rather than solving the problem from scratch each time new observations become available, one uses the model to ``forecast'' the current state, using a prior state estimate (which incorporates information from past data) as the initial condition, then uses current data to correct the prior forecast to a current state estimate. This Bayesian approach is most effective when the uncertainty in both the observations and in the state estimate, as it evolves over time, are accurately quantified. In this article, we describe a practical method for data assimilation in large, spatiotemporally chaotic systems. The method is a type of ``ensemble Kalman filter'', in which the state estimate and its approximate uncertainty are represented at any given time by an ensemble of system states. We discuss both the mathematical basis of this approach and its implementation; our primary emphasis is on ease of use and computational speed rather than improving accuracy over previously published approaches to ensemble Kalman filtering. We include some numerical results demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of our implementation for assimilating real atmospheric data with the global forecast model used by the US National Weather Service.},

abstract = {Contribution of persistent Na+ current and M-type K+ current to somatic bursting in CA1 pyramidal cells: combined experimental and modeling Study. J Neurophysiol 96: 1912-1926, 2006. First published June 28, 2006; doi: 10.1152/jn. 00205.2006. The intrinsic firing modes of adult CA1 pyramidal cells vary along a continuum of "burstiness" from regular firing to rhythmic bursting, depending on the ionic composition of the extracellular milieu. Burstiness is low in neurons exposed to a normal extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](o)), but is markedly enhanced by lowering [Ca2+](o), although not by blocking Ca2+ and Ca2+-activated K+ currents. We show, using intracellular recordings, that burstiness in low [Ca2+](o) persists even after truncating the apical dendrites, suggesting that bursts are generated by an interplay of membrane currents at or near the soma. To study the mechanisms of bursting, we have constructed a conductance-based, one-compartment model of CA1 pyramidal neurons. In this neuron model, reduced [Ca2+](o) is simulated by negatively shifting the activation curve of the persistent Na+ current (I-NaP) as indicated by recent experimental results. The neuron model accounts, with different parameter sets, for the diversity of firing patterns observed experimentally in both zero and normal [Ca2+](o). Increasing INaP in the neuron model induces bursting and increases the number of spikes within a burst but is neither necessary nor sufficient for bursting. We show, using fast-slow analysis and bifurcation theory, that the M-type K+ current (I-M) allows bursting by shifting neuronal behavior between a silent and a tonically active state provided the kinetics of the spike generating currents are sufficiently, although not extremely, fast. We suggest that bursting in CA1 pyramidal cells can be explained by a single compartment "square bursting" mechanism with one slow variable, the activation of I-M.},

title = {Mechanisms of potentiation of mossy fiber EPSCs in the cerebellar nuclei by coincident synaptic excitation and inhibition},
abstract = {Neurons of the cerebellar nuclei receive synaptic excitation from cerebellar mossy fibers. Unlike in many principal neurons, coincident presynaptic activity and postsynaptic depolarization do not generate long-term potentiation at these synapses. Instead, EPSCs are potentiated by high-frequency trains of presynaptic activity applied with postsynaptic hyperpolarization, in patterns resembling mossy-fiber-mediated excitation and Purkinje-cell-mediated inhibition that are predicted to occur during delay eyelid conditioning. Here, we have used electrophysiology and Ca imaging to test how synaptic excitation and inhibition interact to generate long-lasting synaptic plasticity in nuclear cells in cerebellar slices. We find that the extent of plasticity varies with the relative timing of synaptic excitation and hyperpolarization. Potentiation is most effective when synaptic stimuli precede the postinhibitory rebound by approximately 400 ms, whereas with longer intervals, or with a reverse sequence, EPSCs tend to depress. When basal intracellular Ca is raised by spontaneous firing or reduced by voltage clamping at subthreshold potentials, potentiation is induced as long as the synaptic-rebound temporal sequence is maintained, suggesting that plasticity does not require Ca levels to exceed a threshold or attain a specific concentration. Although rebound and spike-dependent Ca influx are global, potentiation is synapse specific, and is disrupted by inhibitors of calcineurin or Ca-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, but not PKC. When IPSPs replace the hyperpolarizing step in the induction protocol, potentiation proceeds normally. These results lead us to propose that synaptic and inhibitory/rebound stimuli initiate separate processes, with local NMDA receptor-mediated Ca influx "priming" synapses, and Ca changes from the inhibition and rebound "triggering" potentiation at recently activated synapses.},

title = {Inhibitory "noise"},
abstract = {Cortical neurons in vivo may operate in high-conductance states, in which the major part of the neuron's input conductance is due to synaptic activity, sometimes several-fold larger than the resting conductance. We examine here the contribution of inhibition in such high-conductance states. At the level of the absolute conductance values, several studies have shown that cortical neurons in vivo are characterized by strong inhibitory conductances. However, conductances are balanced and spiking activity is mostly determined by fluctuations, but not much is known about excitatory and inhibitory contributions to these fluctuations. Models and dynamic-clamp experiments show that, during high-conductance states, spikes are mainly determined by fluctuations of inhibition, or by inhibitory "noise". This stands in contrast to low-conductance states, in which excitatory conductances determine spiking activity. To determine these contributions from experimental data, maximum likelihood methods can be designed and applied to intracellular recordings in vivo. Such methods indicate that action potentials are indeed mostly correlated with inhibitory fluctuations in awake animals. These results argue for a determinant role for inhibitory fluctuations in evoking spikes, and do not support feed-forward modes of processing, for which opposite patterns are predicted.},

Because commonly used desktop operating systems are inherently non-real-time, real-time laboratory computer systems are often based on outdated DOS software or expensive proprietary real-time operating systems. Here we discuss a real-time computing system, based on the free RT-LINUX operating system, which we have developed for adaptive pacing control in a clinical cardiac electrophysiology laboratory. This powerful, flexible, and inexpensive system demonstrates that RT-LINUX is well suited for real-time biomedical experiment interface.},

title = {Pyramidal neurons switch from integrators in vitro to resonators under in vivo-like conditions},
abstract = {During wakefulness, pyramidal neurons in the intact brain are bombarded by synaptic input that causes tonic depolarization, increased membrane conductance (i.e., shunting), and noisy fluctuations in membrane potential; by comparison, pyramidal neurons in acute slices typically experience little background input. Such differences in operating conditions can compromise extrapolation of in vitro data to explain neuronal operation in vivo. For instance, pyramidal neurons have been identified as integrators (i.e., class 1 neurons according to Hodgkin's classification of intrinsic excitability) based on in vitro experiments but that classification is inconsistent with the ability of hippocampal pyramidal neurons to oscillate/resonate at theta frequency since intrinsic oscillatory behavior is limited to class 2 neurons. Using long depolarizing stimuli and dynamic clamp to reproduce in vivo-like conditions in slice experiments, we show that CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells switch from integrators to resonators, i.e., from class 1 to class 2 excitability. The switch is explained by increased outward current contributed by the M-type potassium current I(M), which shifts the balance of inward and outward currents active at perithreshold potentials and thereby converts the spike-initiating mechanism as predicted by dynamical analysis of our computational model. Perithreshold activation of I(M) is enhanced by the depolarizing shift in spike threshold caused by shunting and/or sodium channel inactivation secondary to tonic depolarization. Our conclusions were validated by multiple comparisons between simulation and experimental data. Thus even so-called "intrinsic" properties may differ qualitatively between in vitro and in vivo conditions.},

title = {Movement-related inputs to intermediate cerebellum of the monkey},
abstract = {1. The primary goal of this study was to characterize the information about single-joint forelimb movements supplied to intermediate cerebellar cortex by mossy fibers. Discharge of mossy fibers and Golgi cells was studied while monkeys operated six devices that required movements about specific joints. Additional control experiments in anesthetized cats and monkeys established criteria for identification of mossy fibers and Golgi cells. 2. The control experiments demonstrate that mossy fibers can be distinguished from Purkinje and Golgi cells by the waveshapes of their action potentials. Asynaptic activation from the inferior cerebellar peduncle, in combination with histological localization of recording sites in granular layer or subcortical white matter, verified that mossy fibers produce a variety of waveshapes that are characterized by brief initial phases and relatively small amplitudes. The same waveshapes were observed for the mossy fiber recordings from awake monkeys, and many identified mossy fibers had sensory properties similar to those found in the awake animals. From these combined criteria, we conclude that the recordings in the awake animals were from mossy fibers. Golgi cells, recorded exclusively in the granular layer of cerebellar cortex, were characterized by action potentials of longer duration and larger amplitude as compared with mossy fibers, and none were asynaptically activated from the inferior cerebellar peduncle. 3. Units were isolated while the monkeys made free-form and tracking movements. We studied movement-related discharge of 80 mossy fibers and 12 Golgi cells. Mossy fibers showed high modulations during use of at least one of the six manipulanda and had clear preferences for movement about a specific joint, although they often showed consistent but weaker firing during movement about a neighboring joint. Separation of movements by more than one joint produced a large reduction in discharge: shoulder units never fired well to movements of the finger, and finger units never fired well to movement of the shoulder. 4. The tracking task required maintenance of fixed limb positions (a static phase) as well as movements between these positions (a dynamic phase). Of 80 mossy fibers, 18% had purely tonic discharge patterns, 63% were phasic-tonic, and 20% were purely phasic. Discharge patterns were reciprocal (45%), bidirectional (42%), or unidirectional (13%). 5. Eighty percent of the mossy fibers exhibited tonic discharge that was significantly (P < 0.01) correlated with joint angle (r = 0.65 +/- 0.19, mean +/- SD), and about one third had phasic components that were significantly correlated with movement velocity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

title = {Variation of input-output properties along the somatodendritic axis of pyramidal neurons},
abstract = {The firing evoked by injection of simulated barrages of EPSCs into the proximal dendrite of layer 5 pyramidal neurons is greater than when comparable inputs are injected into the soma. This boosting is mediated by dendritic Na+ conductances. However, the presence of other active conductances in the dendrites, some of which are nonuniformly distributed, suggests that the degree of boosting may differ along the somatodendritic axis. Here, we injected EPSC barrages at the soma and at the proximal, middle, and distal segments of the apical dendrite and measured boosting of subthreshold and suprathreshold responses. We found that although boosting was maintained throughout the apical dendrite, the degree of boosting changed nonmonotonically with distance from the soma. Boosting dipped in the middle dendritic segments as a result of the deactivation of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current, I-h, but increased in the distal dendrites as a result of the activation of Ca2+ conductances. In the distal dendrites, EPSC barrages evoked repetitive bursts of action potentials, and the bursting pattern changed systematically with the magnitude of the input barrages. The quantitative changes in boosting along the somatodendritic axis suggest that inputs from different classes of presynaptic cells are weighted differently, depending on the location of the synaptic contacts. Moreover, the tight coupling between burst characteristics and stimulus parameters indicate that the distal dendrites can support a coding scheme that is different from that at sites closer to the soma, consistent with the notion of a separate dendritic integration site.},

abstract = {Dynamic clamp is a collection of closely related techniques that have been employed in cardiac electrophysiology to provide direct answers to numerous research questions regarding basic cellular mechanisms of action potential formation, action potential transfer and action potential synchronization in health and disease. Building on traditional current clamp, dynamic clamp was initially used to create virtual gap junctions between isolated myocytes. More recent applications include the embedding of a real pacemaking myocyte in a simulated network of atrial or ventricular cells and the insertion of virtual ion channels, either simulated in real time or simultaneously recorded from an expression system, into the membrane of an isolated myocyte. These applications have proven that dynamic clamp, which is characterized by the real-time evaluation and injection of simulated membrane current, is a powerful tool in cardiac electrophysiology. Here, each of the three different experimental configurations used in cardiac electrophysiology is reviewed. Also, directions are given for the implementation of dynamic clamp in the cardiac electrophysiology laboratory. With the growing interest in the application of dynamic clamp in cardiac electrophysiology, it is anticipated that dynamic clamp will also prove a powerful tool in basic research on biological pacemakers and in identification of specific ion channels as targets for drug development.},

abstract = {Intracellular recordings of neuronal membrane potential are a central tool in neurophysiology. In many situations, especially in vivo, the traditional limitation of such recordings is the high electrode resistance and capacitance, which may cause significant measurement errors during current injection. We introduce a computer-aided technique, Active Electrode Compensation (AEC), based on a digital model of the electrode interfaced in real time with the electrophysiological setup. The characteristics of this model are first estimated using white noise current injection. The electrode and membrane contribution are digitally separated, and the recording is then made by online subtraction of the electrode contribution. Tests performed in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that AEC enables high-frequency recordings in demanding conditions, such as injection of conductance noise in dynamic-clamp mode, not feasible with a single high-resistance electrode until now. AEC should be particularly useful to characterize fast neuronal phenomena intracellularly in vivo.},

title = {Impact of synaptic depression on spike timing at the endbulb of Held},
abstract = {Many synapses show short-term depression, but it is not well understood what functional purpose depression serves and whether its effects are beneficial or detrimental to information processing. We study this issue at the synapse made by auditory-nerve (AN) fibers onto bushy cells (BCs) of the cochlear nucleus, called the "endbulb of Held." AN fibers carry timing information about sounds and converge on BCs, which relay timing information to brain areas responsible for sound localization. Dynamic-clamp recordings of BCs in mouse brain slices indicated that nonphase-locked inputs influenced the contribution of phase-locked inputs when all inputs had equal strength. We evaluated whether this situation depended on activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Voltage-clamp recordings indicated that the amount of depression varied over the population of endbulbs, but sibling endbulbs terminating on the same BC had similar plasticity. We tested the effects of endbulb depression on BC spiking using dynamic clamp. Under most conditions, increasing depression led to lower probability of BC spiking. However, the effects on spike timing were highly context dependent. When all inputs carried uniform timing information, depression indirectly affected BC spike precision, by determining how many inputs were required to cross threshold. Earlier work has indicated that this interacts with the temporal distribution of inputs to determine BC spike precision. When inputs carried different timing information, depression greatly improved BC precision by suppressing highly active inputs carrying little phase-locked information. These data suggest that endbulbs with different depression characteristics could produce BCs that enhance response probability or timing under different stimulus conditions.},

title = {Interacting oscillations in neural control of breathing: modeling and qualitative analysis},
abstract = {In mammalian respiration, late-expiratory (late-E, or pre-inspiratory) oscillations emerge in abdominal motor output with increasing metabolic demands (e.g., during hypercapnia, hypoxia, etc.). These oscillations originate in the retrotrapezoid nucleus/parafacial respiratory group (RTN/pFRG) and couple with the respiratory oscillations generated by the interacting neural populations of the B{\"o}tzinger (B{\"o}tC) and pre-B{\"o}tzinger (pre-B{\"o}tC) complexes, representing the kernel of the respiratory central pattern generator. Recently, we analyzed experimental data on the generation of late-E oscillations and proposed a large-scale computational model that simulates the possible interactions between the B{\"o}tC/pre-B{\"o}tC and RTN/pFRG oscillations under different conditions. Here we describe a reduced model that maintains the essential features and architecture of the large-scale model, but relies on simplified activity-based descriptions of neural populations. This simplification allowed us to use methods of dynamical systems theory, such as fast-slow decomposition, bifurcation analysis, and phase plane analysis, to elucidate the mechanisms and dynamics of synchronization between the RTN/pFRG and B{\"o}tC/pre-B{\"o}tC oscillations. Three physiologically relevant behaviors have been analyzed: emergence and quantal acceleration of late-E oscillations during hypercapnia, transformation of the late-E activity into a biphasic-E activity during hypercapnic hypoxia, and quantal slowing of B{\"o}tC/pre-B{\"o}tC oscillations with the reduction of pre-B{\"o}tC excitability. Each behavior is elicited by gradual changes in excitatory drives or other model parameters, reflecting specific changes in metabolic and/or physiological conditions. Our results provide important theoretical insights into interactions between RTN/pFRG and B{\"o}tC/pre-B{\"o}tC oscillations and the role of these interactions in the control of breathing under different metabolic conditions.},

abstract = {Does the afterhyperpolarization current control the gain and discharge variability of motoneurones according to the same law? We investigated this issue in lumbar motoneurones of anaesthetized cats. Using dynamic clamp, we measured the conductance, time constant and driving force of the AHP current in a sample of motoneurones and studied how the gain was correlated to these quantities. To study the action of the AHP on the discharge variability and to compare it to its action on the gain, we injected an artificial AHP-like current in motoneurones. This increased the natural AHR In three motoneurones, we abolished most of the natural AHP with the calcium chelator BAPTA to investigate the condition where the discharge was essentially controlled by the artificial AHP. Our results demonstrate that both the gain and the coefficient of variation of the firing rate are inversely proportional to the magnitude and to the time constant of the artificial AHP conductance. This indicates that the AHP exerts the same control over the gain and the variability. This mechanism ensures that the variability of the discharge is modulated with the gain. This guarantees a great regularity of the discharge when the motoneurone is in a low excitability state and hence good control of the force produced.},

title = {Development of speech prostheses: current status and recent advances},
abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been developed over the past decade to restore communication to persons with severe paralysis. In the most severe cases of paralysis, known as locked-in syndrome, patients retain cognition and sensation, but are capable of only slight voluntary eye movements. For these patients, no standard communication method is available, although some can use BCIs to communicate by selecting letters or words on a computer. Recent research has sought to improve on existing techniques by using BCIs to create a direct prediction of speech utterances rather than to simply control a spelling device. Such methods are the first steps towards speech prostheses as they are intended to entirely replace the vocal apparatus of paralyzed users. This article outlines many well known methods for restoration of communication by BCI and illustrates the difference between spelling devices and direct speech prediction or speech prosthesis.},

title = {Coordination of fast and slow rhythmic neuronal circuits},
abstract = {Interactions among rhythmically active neuronal circuits that oscillate at different frequencies are important for generating complex behaviors, yet little is known about the underlying cellular mechanisms. We addressed this issue in the crab stomatogastric ganglion (STG), which contains two distinct but interacting circuits. These circuits generate the gastric mill rhythm (cycle period, approximately 10 sec) and the pyloric rhythm (cycle period, approximately 1 sec). When the identified modulatory projection neuron named modulatory commissural neuron 1 (MCN1) is activated, the gastric mill motor pattern is generated by interactions among MCN1 and two STG neurons [the lateral gastric (LG) neuron and interneuron 1]. We show that, during MCN1 stimulation, an identified synapse from the pyloric circuit onto the gastric mill circuit is pivotal for determining the gastric mill cycle period and the gastric-pyloric rhythm coordination. To examine the role of this intercircuit synapse, we replaced it with a computational equivalent via the dynamic-clamp technique. This enabled us to manipulate better the timing and strength of this synapse. We found this synapse to be necessary for production of the normal gastric mill cycle period. The synapse acts, during each LG neuron interburst, to boost rhythmically the influence of the modulatory input from MCN1 to LG and thereby to hasten LG neuron burst onset. The two rhythms become coordinated because LG burst onset occurs with a constant latency after the onset of the triggering pyloric input. These results indicate that intercircuit synapses can enable an oscillatory circuit to control the speed of a slower oscillatory circuit, as well as provide a mechanism for intercircuit coordination.},

title = {Subthreshold Voltage Noise Due to Channel Fluctuations in Active Neuronal Membranes},
abstract = {Voltage-gated ion channels in neuronal membranes fluctuate randomly between different conformational states due to thermal agitation. Fluctuations between conducting and nonconducting states give rise to noisy membrane currents and subthreshold voltage fluctuations and may contribute to variability in spike timing. Here we study subthreshold voltage fluctuations due to active voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels as predicted by two commonly used kinetic schemes: the Mainen et al. (1995) (MJHS) kinetic scheme, which has been used to model dendritic channels in cortical neurons, and the classical Hodgkin-Huxley (1952) (HH) kinetic scheme for the squid giant axon. We compute the magnitudes, amplitude distributions, and power spectral densities of the voltage noise in isopotential membrane patches predicted by these kinetic schemes. For both schemes, noise magnitudes increase rapidly with depolarization from rest. Noise is larger for smaller patch areas but is smaller for increased model temperatures. We contrast the results from Monte Carlo simulations of the stochastic nonlinear kinetic schemes with analytical, closed-form expressions derived using passive and quasi-active linear approximations to the kinetic schemes. For all subthreshold voltage ranges, the quasi-active linearized approximation is accurate within 8% and may thus be used in large-scale simulations of realistic neuronal geometries.},

title = {Output organization of intermediate cerebellum of the monkey},
abstract = {1. The goal of this study was to investigate the motor organization of monkey nucleus interpositus (NI) and neighboring regions of the lateral nucleus (NL) by correlating discharge of single neurons with active movements. Neurons were surveyed during free-form movements as well as during operation of six devices that required movement about specific forelimb joints. The paradigm allowed us to test the hypothesis that discharge of individual cells relates to movements about individual joints. 2. One hundred sixty-two isolated nuclear neurons from two monkeys were studied. Eighty-three percent showed large increases in discharge (an average of 3 times resting rate for forelimb neurons) during movement of one body part, either forelimb, hindlimb, mouth/face, or eyes. 3. Anterior interpositus contains neurons related to hindlimb movement in anterior regions and neurons related to forelimb movement in posterior regions. A mouth/face-related area exists in the dorsal-posterior regions and is continuous with a mouth/face area in the dorsal regions of NL. Posterior interpositus (NIP) showed no clear separation between forelimb and hindlimb neurons: forelimb neurons were encountered throughout the nucleus, and hindlimb neurons were encountered in the medial-anterior two thirds. A distinct eye movement area exists in lateral, posterior, and ventral regions of NIP. This area borders regions of NL that also contain eye movement-related neurons. 4. Forelimb interpositus neurons discharged strongly during reach and grasp; discharge rates were recorded for 41 neurons during a stereotyped reach and the average depth of modulation was 149 imp/s. Nineteen neurons that modulated during device tracking were also tested during reaching, and the depth of modulation was much greater during reaching. 5. Fifty-nine forelimb neurons were tested with device tracking. Twenty-seven (46%) produced no audible modulation, regardless of the joint being exercised. The remaining 32 neurons modulated during movement on at least one device (mean depth of modulation = 84 imp/s). Comparison of discharge during use of different devices revealed no strong evidence for device-specific discharge. 6. Discharge modulations during device tracking were phasic, preceded movement, and, for a small number of cells, showed consistent parametric relations to duration, amplitude, and velocity of movement. 7. Despite a clear somatotopy within NI and NL, there is no finer mapping based on active movements about individual joints within forelimb regions. Discharge modulation depends on movements involving the whole limb. Progress in understanding the function of intermediate cerebellum depends on determining the variables required to elicit consistent and high modulation of neural discharge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

title = {A voltage-sensitive dye-based assay for the identification of differentiated neurons derived from embryonic neural stem cell cultures},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pluripotent and multipotent stem cells hold great therapeutical promise for the replacement of degenerated tissue in neurological diseases. To fulfill that promise we have to understand the mechanisms underlying the differentiation of multipotent cells into specific types of neurons. Embryonic stem cell (ESC) and embryonic neural stem cell (NSC) cultures provide a valuable tool to study the processes of neural differentiation, which can be assessed using immunohistochemistry, gene expression, Ca(2+)-imaging or electrophysiology. However, indirect methods such as protein and gene analysis cannot provide direct evidence of neuronal functionality. In contrast, direct methods such as electrophysiological techniques are well suited to produce direct evidence of neural functionality but are limited to the study of a few cells on a culture plate. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we describe a novel method for the detection of action potential-capable neurons differentiated from embryonic NSC cultures using fast voltage-sensitive dyes (VSD). We found that the use of extracellularly applied VSD resulted in a more detailed labeling of cellular processes compared to calcium indicators. In addition, VSD changes in fluorescence translated precisely to action potential kinetics as assessed by the injection of simulated slow and fast sodium currents using the dynamic clamp technique. We further demonstrate the use of a finite element model of the NSC culture cover slip for optimizing electrical stimulation parameters. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our method allows for a repeatable fast and accurate stimulation of neurons derived from stem cell cultures to assess their differentiation state, which is capable of monitoring large amounts of cells without harming the overall culture.},

However, more than 35 years of experience in the estimation community has shown that is difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems that are almost linear on the time scale of the updates. Many of these difficulties arise from its use of linearization. To overcome this limitation, the unscented transformation (UT) was developed as a method to propagate mean and covariance information through nonlinear transformations. It is more accurate, easier to implement, and uses the same order of calculations as linearization. This paper reviews the motivation, development, use, and implications of the UT.},

title = {Memory from the dynamics of intrinsic membrane currents},
abstract = {Almost all theoretical and experimental studies of the mechanisms underlying learning and memory focus on synaptic efficacy and make the implicit assumption that changes in synaptic efficacy are both necessary and sufficient to account for learning and memory. However, network dynamics depends on the complex interaction between intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic strengths and time courses. Furthermore, neuronal activity itself modifies not only synaptic efficacy but also the intrinsic membrane properties of neurons. This paper presents examples demonstrating that neurons with complex temporal dynamics can provide short-term ''memory'' mechanisms that rely solely on intrinsic neuronal properties. Additionally, we discuss the potential role that activity may play in long-term modification of intrinsic neuronal properties. While not replacing synaptic plasticity as a powerful learning mechanism, these examples suggest that memory in networks results from an ongoing interplay between changes in synaptic efficacy and intrinsic membrane properties.},

abstract = {Small assemblies of neurons such as central pattern generators (CPG) are known to express regular oscillatory firing patterns comprising bursts of action potentials. In contrast, individual CPG neurons isolated from the remainder of the network can generate irregular firing patterns. In our study of cooperative behavior in CPGs we developed an analog electronic neuron (EN) that reproduces firing patterns observed in lobster pyloric CPG neurons. Using a tuneable artificial synapse we connected the EN bidirectionally to neurons of this CPG. We found that the periodic bursting oscillation of this mixed assembly depends on the strength and sign of the electrical coupling. Working with identified, isolated pyloric CPG neurons whose network rhythms were impaired, the EN/biological network restored the characteristic CPG rhythm both when the EN oscillations are regular and when they are irregular.

title = {Synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held under in vivo like activity levels},
abstract = {One of the hallmarks of auditory neurons in vivo is spontaneous activity that occurs even in the absence of any sensory stimuli. Sound-evoked bursts of discharges are thus embedded within this background of random firing. The calyx of Held synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) has been characterized in vitro as a fast relay that reliably fires at high stimulus frequencies (< or =800 Hz). However, inherently due to the preparation method, spontaneous activity is absent in studies using brain stem slices. Here we first determine in vivo spontaneous firing rates of MNTB principal cells from Mongolian gerbils and then reintroduce this random firing to in vitro gerbil brain stem synapses at near-physiological temperature. After conditioning synapses with afferent fiber stimulation for 2 min at Poisson averaged rates of 20, 40, and 60 Hz, we observed a number of differences in the properties of synaptic transmission between conditioned and unconditioned synapses. Foremost, we observed reduced steady-state EPSC amplitudes that depressed even further during an embedded short-stimulation train of 100, 300, or 600 Hz (a protocol that thus simulates in vitro what probably occurs at the in vivo MNTB after a short sound stimulus in a silent background). Accordingly, current-clamp, dynamic-clamp, and loose-patch recordings revealed a number of action potential failures at the postsynaptic cell during high-frequency-stimulation trains, although the initial onset of evoked activity was still transmitted with higher fidelity. We thus propose that some in vivo auditory synapses are in a tonic state of reduced EPSC amplitudes as a consequence of high spontaneous spiking and this in vivo-like conditioning has important consequences for the encoding of signals throughout the auditory pathway.},

title = {Improved hybrid clamp: resolution of tail currents following single action potentials},
abstract = {Hybrid clamp protocols, in which a discontinuous single electrode voltage clamp (dSEVC) amplifier is switched from current to voltage clamp during the recording, are frequently used to investigate conductance changes after high frequency trains of action potentials. This technique is advantageous because it combines physiological stimulation of the cell with the possibility of analyzing the consecutive conductance changes quantitatively. In this study an improved hybrid clamp protocol, called dynamic hybrid clamp, is developed that enables the experimenter to study tail currents after single action potentials. The protocol employs real time action potential detection to assure precise timing of the mode switch and utilizes an external sample and hold amplifier to avoid voltage steps during the switch to voltage clamp. With the use of whole-cell patch clamp recordings and high switching frequencies (> or =25 kHz), dSEVC can easily be started with a minimal delay (<1.5 ms) after single action potentials and tail currents underlying afterhyperpolarisations (AHPs) and afterdepolarisations ensuing single spikes are clearly resolved. The dynamic hybrid clamp should also be useful for analysis of spontaneously occurring events such as intrinsic or population bursts.},

abstract = {In the rhythmically active pyloric circuit of the spiny lobster, the pyloric dilator (PD) neurons are members of the pacemaker group of neurons that make inhibitory synapses onto the follower lateral pyloric (LP) neuron. The LP neuron, in turn, makes a depressing inhibitory synapse to the PD neurons, providing the sole inhibitory feedback from the pyloric network to its pacemakers. This study investigates the dynamic interaction between the pyloric cycle period, the two types of neurons, and the feedback synapse in biologically realistic conditions. When the rhythm period was changed, the membrane potential waveform of the LP neuron was affected with a consistent pattern. These changes in the LP neuron waveform directly affected the dynamics of the LP to PD synapse and caused the postsynaptic potential (PSP) in the PD neurons to both peak earlier in phase and become larger in amplitude. Using an artificial synapse implemented in dynamic clamp, we show that when the LP to PD PSP occurred early in phase, it acted to speed up the pyloric rhythm, and larger PSPs also strengthened this trend. Together, these results indicate that interactions between these two types of neurons can dynamically change in response to increases in the rhythm period, and this dynamic change provides a negative feedback to the pacemaker group that could work to stabilize the rhythm period.},

title = {Reliability and precision of neural spike timing: simulation of spectrally broadband synaptic inputs},
abstract = {Spectrally broadband stimulation of neurons has been an effective method for studying their dynamic responses to simulated synaptic inputs. Previous studies with such stimulation were mostly based upon the direct intracellular injection of noisy current waveforms. In the present study we analyze and compare the firing output of various identified molluscan neurons to aperiodic, broadband current signals using three types of stimulus paradigms: 1. direct injection in current clamp mode, 2. conductance injection using electrotonic coupling of the input waveform to the neuron, and 3. conductance injection using a simulated chemical excitatory connection. The current waveforms were presented in 15 successive trials and the trial-to-trial variations of the spike responses were analyzed using peri-stimulus spike density functions. Comparing the responses of the neurons to the same type of input waveforms, we found that conductance injection resulted in more reliable and precise spike responses than direct current injection. The statistical parameters of the response spike trains depended on the spectral distribution of the input. The reliability increased with increasing cutoff frequency, while the temporal jitter of spikes changed in the opposite direction. Neurons with endogenous bursting displayed lower reproducibility in their responses to noisy waveforms when injected directly; however, they fired far more reliably and precisely when receiving the same waveforms as conductance inputs. The results show that molluscan neurons are capable of accurately reproducing their responses to synaptic inputs. Conductance injection provides an enhanced experimental technique for assessing the neurons' spike timing reliability and it should be preferred over direct current injection of noisy waveforms.},

title = {Theory and operation of a single microelectrode voltage clamp},
abstract = {The theory of operation of a discontinuous single-electrode voltage clamp using an ideal microelectrode (infinite response speed) and fixed (current-passing) duty cycle has been previously described. In this paper, the theory is extended by considering a microelectrode which has a finite response speed, by allowing the duty cycle to be variable, and by considering the clamp noise. Formulate are derived for the relationships between the step response, the steady-state error, the steady-state ripple, and the stability, in terms of the cycling frequency, the duty cycle, the open loop gain, and the electrical resistance and capacitance of the microelectrode and the cell membrane. In addition, the amplification of the microelectrode noise by aliasing is analysed, the error due to incomplete decay of the microelectrode voltage is described, and the accuracy of averaging the peak current measurement is established. To achieve the fastest dynamic response and the smallest steady-state error, the cycling period should be made as small as possible, and the open-loop gain should be as large as possible, consistent with stability. Incomplete decay of the microelectrode voltage destabilizes the clamp, and can introduce a significant clamp error. The choice of duty cycle is a compromise between reducing the noise and the step response time while avoiding design problems in the current output circuit. The output noise is amplified by aliasing. It can be minimized for a given output filter cutoff frequency by keeping the cycling frequency as high as possible, and by the use of an anti-aliasing filter whose cutoff frequency must be set for each microelectrode.},

abstract = {Synaptic waveforms, constructed from excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic Poisson trains, are presented to living and computational neurons. We review how the average output of a neuron (e.g., the firing rate) is set by the difference between excitatory and inhibitory event rates while neuronal variability is set by their sum. We distinguish neuronal variability from reproducibility. Variability quantifies how much an output measure is expected to vary; for example, the interspike interval coefficient of variation quantifies the typical range of interspike intervals. Reproducibility quantifies the similarity of neuronal outputs in response to repeated presentations of identical stimuli. Although variability and reproducibility are conceptually distinct, we show that, for ideal current source synapses, reproducibility is defined entirely by variability. For physiologically realistic conductance-based synapses, however, reproducibility is distinct from variability and average output, set by the Poisson rate and the degree of synchrony within the synaptic waveform.},

title = {Dendritic excitability and neuronal morphology as determinants of synaptic efficacy},
abstract = {The ability to trigger neuronal spiking activity is one of the most important functional characteristics of synaptic inputs and can be quantified as a measure of synaptic efficacy (SE). Using model neurons with both highly simplified and real morphological structures (from a single cylindrical dendrite to a hippocampal granule cell, CA1 pyramidal cell, spinal motoneuron, and retinal ganglion neurons) we found that SE of excitatory inputs decreases with the distance from the soma and active nonlinear properties of the dendrites can counterbalance this global effect of attenuation. This phenomenon is frequency dependent, with a more prominent gain in SE observed at lower levels of background input-output neuronal activity. In contrast, there are no significant differences in SE between passive and active dendrites under higher frequencies of background activity. The influence of the nonuniform distribution of active properties on SE is also more prominent at lower background frequencies. In models with real morphologies, the effect of active dendritic conductances becomes more dramatic and inverts the SE relationship between distal and proximal locations. In active dendrites, distal synapses have higher efficacy than that of proximal ones because of arising dendritic spiking in thin branches with high-input resistance. Lower levels of dendritic excitability can make SE independent of the distance from the soma. Although increasing dendritic excitability may boost SE of distal synapses in real neurons, it may actually reduce overall SE. The results are robust with respect to morphological variation and biophysical properties of the model neurons. The model of CA1 pyramidal cell with realistic distributions of dendritic conductances demonstrated important roles of hyperpolarization-activated (h-) current and A-type K(+) current in controlling the efficacy of single synaptic inputs and overall SE differently in basal and apical dendrites.},

abstract = {Neurons of the avian nucleus laminaris (NL) provide a neural substrate for azimuthal sound localization. We examined the optimal stimuli for NL neurons to maintain high discharge rates, reliable phase-locking, and sensitivity to time-delayed stimuli. Whole-cell recordings were performed in chick [embryonic days 19-21 (E19-E21)] NL neurons using an in vitro slice preparation. Variation of membrane properties along the tonotopic axis was examined, Computer-controlled intracellular current injection was used to mimic postsynaptic currents or conductances (PSCs) generated in NL neurons by the firing of nucleus magnocellularis (NM) neurons during acoustic stimulation. At various stimulus frequencies, the effects of varying the number of NM cells and PSC amplitudes on firing rate and phase-locking were examined. During high-frequency stimulation, the greatest firing rate and phase-locking occurred when the protocol contained few NM cells that generated large PSCs. Because the stimulus-evoked unitary PSCs are small, we propose that NM cells fire in synchrony to generate large PSCs. To mimic the arrival of PSCs during binaural stimulation, two stimulus trains were summed at different delays before injection. The firing rate of NL neurons was greatest with zero delay. A delay of half the stimulus period evoked firing that was less than that evoked with a single train. Neurons lacking strong outward rectification exhibited neither reliable phase-locking during high-frequency stimulation nor sensitivity to stimulus delays. These findings suggest that the firing responses of NL neurons are determined primarily by their membrane properties.},

title = {Reliable control of spike rate and spike timing by rapid input transients in cerebellar stellate cells},
abstract = {Granule cell activity in cerebellar cortex directly excites Purkinje cells via parallel fibers, but it also inhibits Purkinje cells via cerebellar cortical interneurons. This contribution of inhibitory interneurons to cerebellar cortical processing remains poorly understood. In the present study we examined the response properties of stellate cells in vitro to input patterns that may result from granule cell activity in vivo. We constructed input waveforms that represented the sum of inputs from all individual synapses and applied these waveforms to the soma of stellate cells during whole cell recordings in acute brain slices. The stimulus waveforms contained fluctuations in a broad range of frequencies and were applied at different amplitudes. To determine the contribution of synaptic shunting to stellate cell spike responses we applied the same input waveforms either as a simulated synaptic conductance using dynamic clamping or as a direct current injection stimulus. Only the dynamic clamp stimulus has the shunting properties of real synapses, i.e. leads to different-sized synaptic current as a function of membrane potential. We found that stellate cells spike with millisecond precision in response to fast temporal fluctuations in the total synaptic input. Transient increases in excitatory input frequency led to pronounced stellate cell spike responses, indicating that this pathway may be very responsive to even small assemblies of co-activated granule cells. This was observed regardless of whether the input waveform was applied as a conductance with dynamic clamping, or as a direct current injection. Thus the shunting properties of a conductance input did not play a major role in determining the control of precisely timed spiking. In contrast, a more tonic increase in excitatory conductance did not lead to a sustained spike response as obtained with prolonged positive current injection. However, even with tonic current injection the precision of spiking was lost, as previously observed. Overall, the synaptic response function of stellate cells suggests that this cell type may pick out transients in granule cell activity, and may generate precisely timed inhibition of Purkinje cells during behavior.

abstract = {We performed a systematic analysis of phase locking in pairs of electrically coupled neocortical fast- spiking ( FS) and low- thresholdspiking ( LTS) interneurons and in a conductance- based model of a pair of FS cells. Phase - response curves ( PRCs) were obtained for real interneurons and the model cells. We used PRCs and the theory of weakly coupled oscillators to make predictions about phase- locking characteristics of cell pairs. Phase locking and the robustness of phase- locked states to differences in intrinsic frequencies of cells were directly examined by driving interneuron pairs through a wide range of firing frequencies. Calculations using PRCs accurately predicted that electrical coupling robustly synchronized the firing of interneurons over all frequencies studied ( FS, similar to 25 - 80 Hz;LTS, similar to 10 - 30 Hz). The synchronizing ability of electrical coupling and the robustness of the phaselocked states were directly dependent on the strength of coupling but not on firing frequency. The FS cell model also predicted the existence of stable antiphase firing at frequencies below similar to 30 Hz, but no evidence for stable antiphase firing was found using the experimentally determined PRCs or in direct measures of phase locking in pairs of interneurons. Despite significant differences in biophysical properties of FS and LTS cells, their phase- locking behavior was remarkably similar. The wide spikes and shallow action potential afterhyperpolarizations of interneurons, compared with the model, prohibited antiphase behavior. Electrical coupling between cortical interneurons of the same type maintained robust synchronous firing of cell pairs for up to similar to 10% heterogeneity in their intrinsic frequencies.},

title = {States of high conductance in a large-scale model of the visual cortex},
abstract = {This paper reports on the consequences of large, activity dependent, synaptic conductances for neurons in a large-scale neuronal network model of the input layer 4Calpha of the Macaque primary visual cortex (Area V1). This high conductance state accounts for experimental observations about orientation selectivity, dynamics, and response magnitude (D. McLaughlin et al. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97: 8087-8092), and the linear dependence of Simple cells on visual stimuli (J. Wielaard et al. (2001) J. Neuroscience 21: 5203-5211). The source of large conductances in the model can be traced to inhibitory corticocortical synapses, and the model's predictions of large conductance changes are consistent with recent intracellular measurements (L. Borg-Graham et al. (1998) Nature 393: 369-373; J. Hirsch et al. (1998) J. Neuroscience 15: 9517-9528; J.S. Anderson et al. (2000) J. Neurophysiol. 84: 909-926). During visual stimulation, these conductances are large enough that their associated time-scales become the shortest in the model cortex, even below that of synaptic interactions. One consequence of this activity driven separation of time-scales is that a neuron responds very quickly to temporal changes in its synaptic drive, with its intracellular membrane potential tracking closely an effective reversal potential composed of the instantaneous synaptic inputs. From the effective potential and large synaptic conductance, the spiking activity of a cell can be expressed in an interesting and simplified manner, with the result suggesting how accurate and smoothly graded responses are achieved in the model network. Further, since neurons in this high-conductance state respond quickly, they are also good candidates as coincidence detectors and burst transmitters.},

title = {Dendritic integration of excitatory synaptic input},
abstract = {A fundamental function of nerve cells is the transformation of incoming synaptic information into specific patterns of action potential output. An important component of this transformation is synaptic integration--the combination of voltage deflections produced by a myriad of synaptic inputs into a singular change in membrane potential. There are three basic elements involved in integration: the amplitude of the unitary postsynaptic potential; the manner in which non-simultaneous unitary events add in time (temporal summation), and the addition of unitary events occurring simultaneously in separate regions of the dendritic arbor (spatial summation). This review discusses how passive and active dendritic properties, and the functional characteristics of the synapse, shape these three elements of synaptic integration.},

title = {Resonant or not, two amplification modes of proprioceptive inputs by persistent inward currents in spinal motoneurons},
abstract = {Why do motoneurons possess two persistent inward currents (PICs), a fast sodium current and a slow calcium current? To answer this question, we replaced the natural PICs with dynamic clamp-imposed artificial PICs at the soma of spinal motoneurons of anesthetized cats. We investigated how PICs with different kinetics (1-100 ms) amplify proprioceptive inputs. We showed that their action depends on the presence or absence of a resonance created by the I(h) current. In resonant motoneurons, a fast PIC enhances the resonance and amplifies the dynamic component of Ia inputs elicited by ramp-and-hold muscle stretches. This facilitates the recruitment of these motoneurons, which likely innervate fast contracting motor units developing large forces, e.g., to restore balance or produce ballistic movements. In nonresonant motoneurons, in contrast, a fast PIC easily triggers plateau potentials, which leads to a dramatic amplification of the static component of Ia inputs. This likely facilitates the recruitment of these motoneurons, innervating mostly slowly contracting and fatigue-resistant motor units, during postural activities. Finally, a slow PIC may switch a resonant motoneuron to nonresonant by counterbalancing I(h), thus changing the action of the fast PIC. A modeling study shows that I(h) needs to be located on the dendrites to create the resonance, and it predicts that dendritic PICs amplify synaptic input in the same manner as somatic PICs.},

title = {Single-unit activity of cerebellar nuclear cells in the awake genetically dystonic rat},
abstract = {The purpose of this study was to characterize neuronal activity in the deep cerebellar nuclei of the unanesthetized genetically dystonic rat during the neonatal period when the clinical signs of the dystonic syndrome first appear. Previous lesion studies have established cerebellar output as critical to the expression of the dystonic rat's motor syndrome, a disorder that closely resembles generalized dystonia in humans. In the dystonic rat, both cerebellectomy and selective lesions of the deep cerebellar nuclei decrease the frequency of abnormal motor signs and improve performance on tests of motor function. Single-unit activity was recorded from the medial, interpositus and lateral cerebellar nuclei in awake normal (N=49) and dystonic (N=54) rats at postnatal days 12-26. One hundred and eighty-three cells were isolated, 91 from normal and 92 from dystonic rats. Interspike interval histograms, autocorrelations and ratemeter histograms were generated for each cell's spike train. Interspike interval histograms were modeled with single and double gamma distributions. Cells from dystonic rats as young as 12 days of age showed bursting firing patterns, positively skewed or bimodal interspike interval histograms, and sinusoidal autocorrelations. Bursting activity increased linearly with postnatal age in dystonic rats. Cells from normal rats demonstrated non-sinusoidal autocorrelations and unimodal interspike interval histograms. Spike frequency increased linearly with postnatal age in both normal and dystonic rats. There were no statistically significant group differences in spike frequency between normal and dystonic rats. These findings show that functional neuropathology can be detected at the level of single neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei at the earliest behavioral stages of the dystonic rat's movement disorder. The degree of abnormality in spike train parameters correlates with the severity of the movement disorder. Independent of neuronal firing rates, abnormal neuronal firing patterns can serve as a guide to the localization of pathological cell populations within the central nervous system. These results provide additional evidence that abnormal cerebellar output plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of the dystonic rat's motor syndrome.},

title = {Sodium along with low-threshold potassium currents enhance coincidence detection of subthreshold noisy signals in MSO neurons},
abstract = {Voltage-dependent membrane conductances support specific neurophysiological properties. To investigate the mechanisms of coincidence detection, we activated gerbil medial superior olivary (MSO) neurons with dynamic current-clamp stimuli in vitro. Spike-triggered reverse-correlation analysis for injected current was used to evaluate the integration of subthreshold noisy signals. Consistent with previous reports, the partial blockade of low-threshold potassium channels (I(KLT)) reduced coincidence detection by slowing the rise of current needed on average to evoke a spike. However, two factors point toward the involvement of a second mechanism. First, the reverse correlation currents revealed that spike generation was associated with a preceding hyperpolarization. Second, rebound action potentials are 45% larger compared to depolarization-evoked spikes in the presence of an I(KLT) antagonist. These observations suggest that the sodium current (I(Na)) was substantially inactivated at rest. To test this idea, I(Na) was enhanced by increasing extracellular sodium concentration. This manipulation reduced coincidence detection, as reflected by slower spike-triggering current, and diminished the hyperpolarization phase in the reverse-correlation currents. As expected, a small outward bias current decreased the pre-spike hyperpolarization phase, and TTX blockade of I(Na) nearly eliminated the hyperpolarization phase in the reverse correlation current. A computer model including Hodgkin-Huxley type conductances for spike generation and for I(KLT) showed reduction in coincidence detection when I(KLT) was reduced or when I(Na) was increased. We hypothesize that desirable synaptic signals first remove some inactivation of I(Na) and reduce activation of I(KLT) to create a brief temporal window for coincidence detection of subthreshold noisy signals.},

title = {Inhibitory coupling specifically generates emergent gamma oscillations in diverse cell types},
abstract = {Networks of inhibitory neurons regulate synchrony during many physiological and pathological oscillations. To explore how these effects depend on cellular, network, and synaptic factors, we developed and validated a semisynthetic inhibitory network that approximates simultaneous activity in multiple neurons by using consecutive responses from single cells. We recorded from three types of neurons, each of which forms interconnected networks in vivo, but has unique intrinsic properties. In all three cell types, fast inhibitory coupling generated emergent gamma oscillations. By contrast, inhibitory coupling desynchronized slower, spindle-frequency responses specifically in thalamic reticular neurons. The emergent gamma-frequency synchronization was also specific to tonic input and did not occur during responses to phasic inputs. These results illustrate how particular features of inhibitory networks (e.g., cell or input type) contribute to their synchronizing or desynchronizing functions. They also demonstrate phenomena (emergent gamma oscillations) that occur robustly in multiple cell types and may thus be a generic feature of inhibitory networks throughout the brain.},

title = {Cable analysis with the whole-cell patch clamp. Theory and experiment},
abstract = {A theoretical analysis was undertaken of a Rall motoneuron under voltage clamp with a finite access resistance. This model is relevant to the conditions of the whole-cell patch clamp, which to date has been used very little for cable analysis. It was shown that the soma and cable charging currents can be distinguished, and that the soma is charged with a time constant approximately equal to the access resistance times the somatic capacitance. Thus, the charging time of the soma is similar to what it would be if the cell had no process. Simple formulas were derived that can be used to calculate the electrotonic length, the membrane time constant, and the soma-dendrite resistance ratio of a cell with a cylindrical process. With the aid of these formulas, reasonable estimates of parameter values were recovered from simulated transient currents. Tests of the Rall model were proposed to determine when there is an equivalent cylinder that is consistent with observed charging behavior. The analysis was extended to a cable with an open end and to a model in which the soma and dendrite have different membrane time constants. It was shown that with voltage-clamp data estimates of electrical parameters other than rho are relatively insensitive to differences between the membrane properties of the soma and dendrite. The methods of cable analysis introduced here were illustrated by application to charging transients recorded from a hippocampal pyramidal cell and from a neurohypophysial nerve ending. The Rall model provided a good description of the pyramidal cell current transient but was inconsistent with the charging behavior observed for the nerve ending. With the recent technical advance of patch clamp recording in brain slices, the analysis presented here should help neurophysiologists investigate cable properties in a wide variety of systems.},

title = {Time window control: a model for cerebellar function based on synchronization, reverberation, and time slicing},
abstract = {We present a new hypothesis of cerebellar function that is based on synchronization, delayed reverberation, and time windows for triggering spikes. Our model suggests that granule cells admit mossy fiber activity to the parallel fibers only if the Golgi cells are firing synchronously and if the mossy-fiber spikes arrive within short and well-defined time windows. The concept of time window control organizes neuronal activity in discrete 'time slices' that can be used to discern meaningful information from background noise. In particular, Purkinje cell activity can trigger rebound spikes in deep cerebellar nuclei cells, which project via brain stem nuclei and mossy fibers back to the cerebellar cortex. Using a detailed model of deep cerebellar nuclei cells, we demonstrate that the delayed firing of rebound spikes is a robust mechanism so as to ensure that the reverberated activity re-arrives in the mossy fibers just during the granule-cell time window. Large network simulations reveal that synaptic plasticity (LTD and LTP) at the parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapses that relies on the timing of the parallel fiber and climbing fiber activities allows the system to learn, store, and recall spatiotemporal patterns of spike activity. Climbing fiber spikes function both as teacher and as synchronization signals. The temporal characteristics of the climbing fiber activity are due to intrinsic oscillatory properties of inferior olivary neurons and to reverberating projections between deep cerebellar nuclei, the mesodiencephalic junction, and the inferior olive. Thus, the reverberating loops of the mossy fiber system and climbing fiber system may interact directly with the time windows provided by the circuitry of the cerebellar cortex so as to generate the appropriate spatio-temporal firing patterns in the deep cerebellar nuclei neurons that control premotor systems. In future studies the model will be extended in that high frequency simple spike activities will be included and that their relevance for motor control will be addressed.},

title = {All thalamocortical neurones possess a T-type Ca2+ 'window' current that enables the expression of bistability-mediated activities},
abstract = {1. The existence of a non-negligible steady-state ('window') component of the low threshold, T-type Ca2+current (IT) and an appropriately large ratio of IT to ILeak conductance (i.e. gT/gLeak) have been shown to underlie a novel form of intrinsic bistability that is present in about 15 % of thalamocortical (TC) neurones. 2. In the present experiments, the dynamic clamp technique was used to introduce into mammalian TC neurones in vitro either an artificial, i.e. computer-generated, IT in order to enhance endogenous IT, or an artificial inward ILeak to decrease endogenous ILeak. Using this method, we were able to investigate directly whether the majority of TC neurones appear non-bistable because their intrinsic ionic membrane properties are essentially different (i.e. presence of a negligible IT 'window' component), or simply because they possess a gT or gLeak conductance that is insufficiently large or small, respectively. 3. The validity of the dynamic clamp arrangement and the accuracy of artificial IT were confirmed by (i) recreating the low threshold calcium potential (LTCP) with artificial IT following its block by Ni2+ (0.5-1 mM), and (ii) blocking endogenous LTCPs with an artificial outward IT. 4. Augmentation of endogenous IT by an artificial analog or introduction of an artificial inward ILeak transformed all non-bistable TC neurones to bistable cells that expressed the full array of bistability-mediated behaviours, i.e. input signal amplification, slow oscillatory activity and membrane potential bistability. 5. These results demonstrate the existence of a non-negligible IT 'window' component in all TC neurones and suggest that rather than being a novel group of neurones, bistable cells are merely representative of an interesting region of dynamical modes in the (gT, gLeak) parameter space that may be expressed under certain physiological or pathological conditions by all TC neurones and other types of excitable cells that possess an IT 'window' component with similar biophysical properties.},

abstract = {Cerebellar Purkinje neurons maintain high firing rates but their synaptic terminals depress only moderately, raising the question of how vesicle depletion is minimized. To identify mechanisms that limit synaptic depression, we evoked 100 Hz trains of GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in cerebellar nuclear neurons by stimulating Purkinje axons in mouse brain slices. The paired-pulse ratio (IPSC2/ IPSC1) of the total IPSC was similar to1 and the steady-state ratio (IPSC20/IPSC1) was similar to0.5, suggesting a high response probability of postsynaptic receptors, without an unusually high release probability. Three-dimensional electron microscopic reconstructions of Purkinje boutons revealed multiple active zones without intervening transporters, suggestive of "spillover"-mediated transmission. Simulations of boutons with 10-16 release sites, in which transmitter from any site can reach all receptors opposite the bouton, replicated multiple-pulse depression during normal, high, and low presynaptic Ca influx. These results suggest that release from multiple-site boutons limits depletion-based depression, permitting prolonged, high-frequency inhibition at corticonuclear synapses.},

We use this method to systematically reduce the dimension of a two-compartment conductance-based model of a crustacean pyloric dilator (PD) neuron that exhibits distinct modes of oscillation--tonic spiking, intermediate bursting and strong bursting. We divide trajectories into intervals dominated by a smaller number of variables, resulting in a locally reduced hybrid model whose dimension varies between two and six in different temporal regimes. The reduced model exhibits the same modes of oscillation as the 16 dimensional model over a comparable parameter range, and requires fewer ad hoc simplifications than a more traditional reduction to a single, globally valid model. The hybrid model highlights low-dimensional organizing structure in the dynamics of the PD neuron, and the dependence of its oscillations on parameters such as the maximal conductances of calcium currents. Our technique could be used to build hybrid low-dimensional models from any large multi-compartment conductance-based model in order to analyze the interactions between different modes of activity.},

title = {Motor pattern switching in the heartbeat pattern generator of the medicinal leech: membrane properties and lack of synaptic interaction in switch interneurons},
abstract = {The motor program for heartbeat in the medicinal leech is produced by a central pattern generator that regularly switches between two alternative coordination states. A pair of switch heart interneurons reciprocally alternate between rhythmically active and inactive states to effect these switches. During spontaneous switches in the activity state of switch interneurons, there was no correlation between the duration of a particular activity state and beat period, indicating that the timing networks for the switch cycle and the beat cycle are relatively independent. Simultaneous recordings from two switch heart interneurons showed that a perturbation in the electrical activity of one does not influence switching of the other and that there is no synaptic interaction between them. Using voltage clamp, we characterized an L-like Ca2+ current (measured as Ba2+ currents), inactivating and non-inactivating K+ currents, a persistent Na+ current, and a hyperpolarization-activated inward current in switch interneurons. Dynamic clamp experiments show that "subtraction" of an artificial switch leak conductance (described previously by Gramoll et al. 1994) from a switch interneuron when it is in the inactive state causes it to display activity associated with the active state. We discuss how the switch leak conductance may interact with the intrinsic currents of switch interneurons to control their activity state.},

abstract = {In vivo studies suggest that precise firing of neurons is important for correct sensory representation. Principal neocortical neurons fire imprecisely when repeatedly activated by fixed sensory stimuli or current depolarizations. Here we show that in contrast to pyramidal neurons, firing in neocortical GABAergic fast-spiking (FS) interneurons is quite precise. FS interneurons are self-innervated by powerful GABAergic autaptic connections reliably activated after each spike, suggesting that autapses strongly regulate FS-cell spike timing. Indeed, blockade of autaptic transmission degraded temporal precision in multiple ways. Under these conditions, realistic dynamic-clamp hyperpolarizing autapses restored precision of spike timing, even in the presence of synaptic noise. Furthermore, firing precision was increased in pyramidal neurons by artificial GABAergic autaptic conductances, suggesting that tightly coupled synaptic feedback inhibition regulates spike timing in principal cells. Thus, well-timed inhibition, whether autaptic or synaptic, facilitates precise spike timing and promotes synchronized cortical network oscillations relevant to several behaviors.},

Current noise enters the membrane equation directly while conductance noise is propagated through the activation variables. Additive Gaussian white noise which is implemented as conductance noise appears in the voltage equations as an additive and a multiplicative term. Moreover, the originally white noise is turned into colored noise. The noise correlation time is a function of the system's control parameters which may explain the different effects of current and conductance noise in different dynamic states. We have found the most significant, qualitative differences between different noise implementations in a pacemaker-like, tonic firing regime at the transition to chaotic burst discharges.

title = {Ionic mechanism underlying recovery of rhythmic activity in adult isolated neurons},
abstract = {Neurons exhibit long-term excitability changes necessary for maintaining proper cell and network activity in response to various inputs and perturbations. For instance, the adult crustacean pyloric network can spontaneously recover rhythmic activity after complete shutdown resulting from permanent removal of neuromodulatory inputs. Dissociated lobster stomatogastric ganglion (STG) neurons have been shown to spontaneously develop oscillatory activity via excitability changes. Rhythmic electrical stimulation can eliminate these oscillatory patterns in some cells. The ionic mechanisms underlying these changes are only partially understood. We used dissociated crab STG neurons to study the ionic mechanisms underlying spontaneous recovery of rhythmic activity and stimulation-induced activity changes. Similar to lobster neurons, rhythmic activity spontaneously develops in crab STG neurons. Rhythmic hyperpolarizing stimulation can eliminate, but more commonly accelerate, the emergence of stable oscillatory activity depending on Ca2+ influx at hyperpolarized voltages. Our main finding is that upregulation of a Ca2+ current and downregulation of a high-threshold K+ current underlies the spontaneous homeostatic development of oscillatory activity. However, because of a nonlinear dependence on stimulus frequency, hyperpolarization-induced oscillations appear to be inconsistent with a homeostatic regulation of activity. We find no difference in the activity patterns or the underlying ionic currents involved between neurons of the fast pyloric and the slow gastric mill networks during the first 10 days in isolation. Dynamic-clamp experiments confirm that these conductance modifications can explain the observed activity changes. We conclude that spontaneous and stimulation-induced excitability changes in STG neurons can both result in intrinsic oscillatory activity via regulation of the same two conductances.},

abstract = {Episodic release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) is obligatory for mammalian reproduction. The contribution of synaptic input to intermittent firing of GnRH neurons is unclear. GnRH neurons have very few synapses and most post-synaptic currents are small. Therefore, the impact of synaptic currents on firing in GnRH neurons was directly examined using simulated (S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5methyl-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-like inputs applied with the method of dynamic current clamping. Tightly synchronized inputs and 50 ms bursts of excitatory input resulted in action potentials that were coincident with the stimulus. Neither input pattern resulted in sustained firing. When ongoing patterns of simulated inputs were applied over a range of parameters, action potentials were associated with clusters of AMPA-like inputs of 250 pS (approximately 15 pA amplitudes), while single inputs of 500 pS (approximately 30 pA amplitudes) resulted in action potentials. Ongoing inputs of 500 pS drove firing at 4-9 Hz. These findings provide evidence that small, simulated glutamatergic inputs can control firing in GnRH neurons and suggest that despite the small amplitudes, endogenous synaptic input mediated by glutamate may contribute to firing in GnRH neurons.

title = {Online detection and sorting of extracellularly recorded action potentials in human medial temporal lobe recordings, in vivo},
abstract = {Understanding the function of complex cortical circuits requires the simultaneous recording of action potentials from many neurons in awake and behaving animals. Practically, this can be achieved by extracellularly recording from multiple brain sites using single wire electrodes. However, in densely packed neural structures such as the human hippocampus, a single electrode can record the activity of multiple neurons. Thus, analytic techniques that differentiate action potentials of different neurons are required. Offline spike sorting approaches are currently used to detect and sort action potentials after finishing the experiment. Because the opportunities to record from the human brain are relatively rare, it is desirable to analyze large numbers of simultaneous recordings quickly using online sorting and detection algorithms. In this way, the experiment can be optimized for the particular response properties of the recorded neurons. Here we present and evaluate a method that is capable of detecting and sorting extracellular single-wire recordings in realtime. We demonstrate the utility of the method by applying it to an extensive data set we acquired from chronically implanted depth electrodes in the hippocampus of human epilepsy patients. This dataset is particularly challenging because it was recorded in a noisy clinical environment. This method will allow the development of "closed-loop" experiments, which immediately adapt the experimental stimuli and/or tasks to the neural response observed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The LP neuron was found to have only four or five degrees of freedom in the isolated condition and displayed chaotic behavior. We show that this chaotic behavior could be regularized by periodic pulses of negative current injected into the neuron or by coupling it to another neuron via inhibitory connections. We used both a modified Hindmarsh-Rose model to simulate the neurons behavior phenomenologically and a more realistic conductance-based model so that the modeling could be linked to the experimental observations. Both models were able to capture the dynamics of the neuron behavior better than previous models. We used the Hindmarsh-Rose model as the basis for building electronic neurons which could then be integrated into the biological circuitry. Such neurons were able to rescue patterns which had been disabled by removing key biological neurons from the circuit. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Spike timing reliability of neuronal responses depends on the frequency content of the input. We investigate how intrinsic properties of cortical neurons affect spike timing reliability in response to rhythmic inputs of suprathreshold mean. Analyzing reliability of conductance-based cortical model neurons on the basis of a correlation measure, we show two aspects of how ionic conductances influence spike timing reliability. First, they set the preferred frequency for spike timing reliability, which in accordance with the resonance effect of spike timing reliability is well approximated by the firing rate of a neuron in response to the DC component in the input. We demonstrate that a slow potassium current can modulate the spike timing frequency preference over a broad range of frequencies. This result is confirmed experimentally by dynamic-clamp recordings from rat prefrontal cortical neurons in vitro. Second, we provide evidence that ionic conductances also influence spike timing beyond changes in preferred frequency. Cells with the same DC firing rate exhibit more reliable spike timing at the preferred frequency and its harmonics if the slow potassium current is larger and its kinetics are faster, whereas a larger persistent sodium current impairs reliability. We predict that potassium channels are an efficient target for neuromodulators that can tune spike timing reliability to a given rhythmic input.},

title = {Persistent sodium current, membrane properties and bursting behavior of pre-Botzinger complex inspiratory neurons in vitro},
abstract = {We measured persistent Na+ current and membrane properties of bursting-pacemaker and nonbursting inspiratory neurons of the neonatal rat pre-Botzinger complex (pre-BotC) in brain stem slice preparations with a rhythmically active respiratory network in vitro. In whole-cell recordings, slow voltage ramps (less than or equal to100 mV/s) inactivated the fast, spike-generating Na+ current and yielded N-shaped current-voltage relationships with nonmonotonic, negative-slope regions between -60 and -35 mV when the voltage-sensitive component was isolated. The underlying current was a TTX-sensitive persistent Na+ current (I-NaP) since the inward current was present at slow voltage ramp speeds (3.3-100 mV/s) and the current was blocked by 1 muM TTX. We measured the biophysical properties of I-NaP after subtracting the voltage-insensitive "leak" current (I-Leak) in the presence of Cd2+ and in some cases tetraethylammonium (TEA). Peak I-NaP ranged from -50 to -200 pA at a membrane potential of -30 mV. Decreasing the speed of the voltage ramp caused time-dependent I-NaP inactivation, but this current was present at ramp speeds as low as 3.3 mV/s. I-NaP activated at -60 mV and obtained half-maximal activation near -40 mV. The subthreshold voltage dependence and slow inactivation kinetics of I-NaP, which closely resemble those of I-NaP mathematically modeled as a burst-generation mechanism in pacemaker neurons of the pre-BotC, suggest that I-NaP predominantly influences bursting dynamics of pre-BotC inspiratory pacemaker neurons in vitro. We also found that the ratio of persistent Na+ conductance to leak conductance (g(NaP)/g(Leak)) can distinguish the phenotypic subpopulations of bursting pacemaker and nonbursting inspiratory neurons: pacemaker neurons showed g(NaP) /g(Leak) > g(NaP) / g(Leak) in nonpacemaker cells (P < 0.0002). We conclude that I-NaP is ubiquitously expressed by pre-BotC inspiratory neurons and that bursting pacemaker behavior within the heterogeneous population of inspiratory neurons is achieved with specific ratios of these two conductances, g(NaP) and g(Leak).},

title = {Inhibitory synchronization of bursting in biological neurons: dependence on synaptic time constant},
abstract = {Using the dynamic clamp technique, we investigated the effects of varying the time constant of mutual synaptic inhibition on the synchronization of bursting biological neurons. For this purpose, we constructed artificial half-center circuits by inserting simulated reciprocal inhibitory synapses between identified neurons of the pyloric circuit in the lobster stomatogastric ganglion. With natural synaptic interactions blocked (but modulatory inputs retained), these neurons generated independent, repetitive bursts of spikes with cycle period durations of approximately 1 s. After coupling the neurons with simulated reciprocal inhibition, we selectively varied the time constant governing the rate of synaptic activation and deactivation. At time constants <or=100 ms, bursting was coordinated in an alternating (anti-phase) rhythm. At longer time constants (>400 ms), bursts became phase-locked in a fully overlapping pattern with little or no phase lag and a shorter period. During the in-phase bursting, the higher-frequency spiking activity was not synchronized. If the circuit lacked a robust periodic burster, increasing the time constant evoked a sharp transition from out-of-phase oscillations to in-phase oscillations with associated intermittent phase-jumping. When a coupled periodic burster neuron was present (on one side of the half-center circuit), the transition was more gradual. We conclude that the magnitude and stability of phase differences between mutually inhibitory neurons varies with the ratio of burst cycle period duration to synaptic time constant and that cellular bursting (whether periodic or irregular) can adopt in-phase coordination when inhibitory synaptic currents are sufficiently slow.},

title = {Nonlinear interaction between shunting and adaptation controls a switch between integration and coincidence detection in pyramidal neuron},
abstract = {The membrane conductance of a pyramidal neuron in vivo is substantially increased by background synaptic input. Increased membrane conductance, or shunting, does not simply reduce neuronal excitability. Recordings from hippocampal pyramidal neurons using dynamic clamp revealed that adaptation caused complete cessation of spiking in the high conductance state, whereas repetitive spiking could persist despite adaptation in the low conductance state. This behavior was reproduced in a phase plane model and was explained by a shunting-induced increase in voltage threshold. The increase in threshold allows greater activation of the M current (I-M) at subthreshold potentials and reduces the minimum adaptation required to stabilize the system; in contrast, activation of the after hyperpolarization current is unaffected by the increase in threshold and therefore remains unable to stop repetitive spiking. The nonlinear interaction between shunting and IM has other important consequences. First, timing of spikes elicited by brief stimuli is more precise when background spikes elicited by sustained input are prohibited, as occurs exclusively with I-M-mediated adaptation in the high conductance state. Second, activation of IM at subthreshold potentials, which is increased in the high conductance state, hyperpolarizes average membrane potential away from voltage threshold, allowing only large, rapid fluctuations to reach threshold and elicit spikes. These results suggest that the shift from a low to high conductance state in a pyramidal neuron is accompanied by a switch from encoding time-averaged input with firing rate to encoding transient inputs with precisely timed spikes, in effect, switching the operational mode from integration to coincidence detection.},

title = {Integration of broadband conductance input in rat somatosensory cortical inhibitory interneurons: an inhibition-controlled switch between intrinsic and input-driven spiking in fast-spiking cells},
abstract = {Quantitative understanding of the dynamics of particular cell types when responding to complex, natural inputs is an important prerequisite for understanding the operation of the cortical network. Different types of inhibitory neurons are connected by electrical synapses to nearby neurons of the same type, enabling the formation of synchronized assemblies of neurons with distinct dynamical behaviors. Under what conditions is spike timing in such cells determined by their intrinsic dynamics and when is it driven by the timing of external input? In this study, we have addressed this question using a systematic approach to characterizing the input-output relationships of three types of cortical interneurons (fast spiking [FS], low-threshold spiking [LTS], and nonpyramidal regular-spiking [NPRS] cells) in the rat somatosensory cortex, during fluctuating conductance input designed to mimic natural complex activity. We measured the shape of average conductance input trajectories preceding spikes and fitted a two-component linear model of neuronal responses, which included an autoregressive term from its own output, to gain insight into the input-output relationships of neurons. This clearly separated the contributions of stimulus and discharge history, in a cell-type dependent manner. Unlike LTS and NPRS cells, FS cells showed a remarkable switch in dynamics, from intrinsically driven spike timing to input-fluctuation-controlled spike timing, with the addition of even a small amount of inhibitory conductance. Such a switch could play a pivotal role in the function of FS cells in organizing coherent gamma oscillations in the local cortical network. Using both pharmacological perturbations and modeling, we show how this property is a consequence of the particular complement of voltage-dependent conductances in these cells.},

title = {Diversity of gain modulation by noise in neocortical neurons: regulation by the slow afterhyperpolarization conductance},
abstract = {Neuronal firing is known to depend on the variance of synaptic input as well as the mean input current. Several studies suggest that input variance, or "noise," has a divisive effect, reducing the slope or gain of the firing frequency-current (f-I) relationship. We measured the effects of current noise on f-I relationships in pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking (FS) interneurons in slices of rat sensorimotor cortex. In most pyramidal neurons, noise had a multiplicative effect on the steady-state f-I relationship, increasing gain. In contrast, noise reduced gain in FS interneurons. Gain enhancement in pyramidal neurons increased with stimulus duration and was correlated with the amplitude of the slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP), a major mechanism of spike-frequency adaptation. The 5-HT2 receptor agonist alpha-methyl-5-HT reduced the sAHP and eliminated gain increases, whereas augmenting the sAHP conductance by spike-triggered dynamic-current clamp enhanced the gain increase. These results indicate that the effects of noise differ fundamentally between classes of neocortical neurons, depending on specific biophysical properties including the sAHP conductance. Thus, noise from background synaptic input may enhance network excitability by increasing gain in pyramidal neurons with large sAHPs and reducing gain in inhibitory FS interneurons.},

title = {TASK-3 two-pore domain potassium channels enable sustained high-frequency firing in cerebellar granule neurons},
abstract = {The ability of neurons, such as cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs), to fire action potentials (APs) at high frequencies during sustained depolarization is usually explained in relation to the functional properties of voltage-gated ion channels. Two-pore domain potassium (K(2P)) channels are considered to simply hyperpolarize the resting membrane potential (RMP) by increasing the potassium permeability of the membrane. However, we find that CGNs lacking the TASK-3 type K(2P) channel exhibit marked accommodation of action potential firing. The accommodation phenotype was not associated with any change in the functional properties of the underlying voltage-gated sodium channels, nor could it be explained by the more depolarized RMP that resulted from TASK-3 channel deletion. A functional rescue, involving the introduction of a nonlinear leak conductance with a dynamic current clamp, was able to restore wild-type firing properties to adult TASK-3 knock-out CGNs. Thus, in addition to the accepted role of TASK-3 channels in limiting neuronal excitability, by increasing the resting potassium conductance TASK-3 channels also increase excitability by supporting high-frequency firing once AP threshold is reached.},

title = {Causes of transient instabilities in the dynamic clamp},
abstract = {The dynamic clamp is a widely used method for integrating mathematical models with electrophysiological experiments. This method involves measuring the membrane voltage of a cell, using it to solve computational models of ion channel dynamics in real-time, and injecting the calculated current(s) back into the cell. Limitations of this technique include those associated with single electrode current clamping and the sampling effects caused by the dynamic clamp. In this study, we show that the combination of these limitations causes transient instabilities under certain conditions. Through physical experiments and simulations, we show that dynamic clamp instability is directly related to the sampling delay and the maximum simulated conductance being injected. It is exaggerated by insufficient electrode series resistance and capacitance compensation. Increasing the sampling rate of the dynamic clamp system increases dynamic clamp stability; however, this improvement, is constrained by how well the electrode series resistance and capacitance are compensated. At present, dynamic clamp sampling rates are justified solely on the temporal dynamics of the models being simulated; here we show that faster rates increase the stable range of operation for the dynamic clamp system. In addition, we show that commonly accepted levels of resistance compensation nevertheless significantly compromise the stability of a dynamic clamp system.},

abstract = {The dynamic clamp is a technique which allows the introduction of artificial conductances into living cells. Up to now, this technique has been mainly used to add small numbers of 'virtual' ion channels to real cells or to construct small hybrid neuronal circuits. In this paper we describe a prototype computer system, NeuReal, that extends the dynamic clamp technique to include (i) the attachment of artificial dendritic structures consisting of multiple compartments and (ii) the construction of large hybrid networks comprising several hundred biophysically realistic modelled neurons. NeuReal is a fully interactive system that runs on Windows XP, is written in a combination of C++ and assembler, and uses the Microsoft DirectX application programming interface (API) to achieve high-performance graphics. By using the sampling hardware-based representation of membrane potential at all stages of computation and by employing simple look-up tables, NeuReal can simulate over 1000 independent Hodgkin and Huxley type conductances in real-time on a modern personal computer (PC). In addition, whilst not being a hard real-time system, NeuReal still offers reliable performance and tolerable jitter levels up to an update rate of 50kHz. A key feature of NeuReal is that rather than being a simple dedicated dynamic clamp, it operates as a fast simulation system within which neurons can be specified as either real or simulated. We demonstrate the power of NeuReal with several example experiments and argue that it provides an effective tool for examining various aspects of neuronal function.},

title = {Pacemaker synchronization of electrically coupled rabbit sinoatrial node cells},
abstract = {The effects of intercellular coupling conductance on the activity of two electrically coupled isolated rabbit sinoatrial nodal cells were investigated. A computer-controlled Version of the "coupling clamp" technique was used in which isolated sinoatrial nodal cells, not physically in contact with each other, were electrically coupled at various values of ohmic coupling conductance, mimicking the effects of mutual interaction by electrical coupling through gap junctional channels. We demonstrate the existence of four types of electrical behavior of coupled spontaneously active cells. As the coupling conductance is progressively increased, the cells exhibit: (a) independent pacemaking at low coupling conductances, (b) complex dynamics of activity with mutual interactions, (c) entrainment of action potential frequency at a 1:1 ratio with different action potential waveforms, and ((d) entrainment of action potentials at the same frequency of activation and virtually identical action potential waveforms. The critical value of coupling conductance required for 1:1 frequency entrainment was <0.5 nS in each of the five cell pairs studied. The common interbeat interval at a relatively high coupling conductance (10 nS), which is sufficient to produce entrainment of frequency and also identical action potential waveforms, is determined most by the intrinsically faster pacemaker cell and it can be predicted from the diastolic depolarization times of both cells. Evidence is provided that, at low coupling conductances, mutual pacemaker synchronization results mainly from the phase-resetting effects of the action potential of one cell on the depolarization phase of the other. At high coupling conductances, the tonic, diastolic interactions become more important.},

title = {How much afterhyperpolarization conductance is recruited by an action potential? A dynamic-clamp study in cat lumbar motoneurons},
abstract = {We accurately measured the conductance responsible for the afterhyperpolarization (medium AHP) that follows a single spike in spinal motoneurons of anesthetized cats. This was done by using the dynamic-clamp method. We injected an artificial current in the neurons that increased the AHP amplitude, and we made use of the fact that the intensity of the natural AHP current at the trough of the voltage trajectory was related linearly to the AHP amplitude. We determined at the same time the conductance and the reversal potential of the AHP current. This new method was validated by a simple theoretical model incorporating AHP and hyperpolarization-activated (Ih) currents and could be applied when the decay time constant of the AHP conductance was at least five times shorter than the estimated Ih activation time. This condition was fulfilled in 33 of 44 motoneurons. The AHP conductance varied from 0.3 to 1.4 microS in both slow- and fast-type motoneurons, which was approximately the same range as the input conductance of the entire population. However, AHP and input conductances were not correlated. The larger AHP in slow-type motoneurons was mainly attributable to their smaller input conductance compared with fast motoneurons. The likeness of the AHP conductance in both types of motoneurons is in sharp contrast to differences in AHP decay time and explains why slow- and fast-type motoneurons have similar gain.},

title = {Release-dependent variations in synaptic latency: a putative code for short- and long-term synaptic dynamics},
abstract = {In the cortex, synaptic latencies display small variations ( approximately 1-2 ms) that are generally considered to be negligible. We show here that the synaptic latency at monosynaptically connected pairs of L5 and CA3 pyramidal neurons is determined by the presynaptic release probability (Pr): synaptic latency being inversely correlated with the amplitude of the postsynaptic current and sensitive to manipulations of Pr. Changes in synaptic latency were also observed when Pr was physiologically regulated in short- and long-term synaptic plasticity. Paired-pulse depression and facilitation were respectively associated with increased and decreased synaptic latencies. Similarly, latencies were prolonged following induction of presynaptic LTD and reduced after LTP induction. We show using the dynamic-clamp technique that the observed covariation in latency and synaptic strength is a synergistic combination that significantly affects postsynaptic spiking. In conclusion, amplitude-related variation in latency represents a putative code for short- and long-term synaptic dynamics in cortical networks.},

title = {Mechanisms underlying directional selectivity for frequency-modulated sweeps in the inferior colliculus revealed by in vivo whole-cell recordings},
abstract = {Auditory neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) show remarkable selectively in that they can distinguish between complex sounds that have identical spectral energy but different temporal structure, such as frequency modulations (FMs) that sweep either upward or downward. Extracellular recordings show that blocking inhibition locally reduces or eliminates response selectivity, suggesting that selectivity is created de novo in the IC, with inhibition playing a prominent role. However, these studies can only infer underlying mechanisms based on spike counts. Using in vivo whole-cell recordings, we examine the mechanisms underlying FM directional selectivity in the IC. We first report that spike threshold can strongly amplify directional selectivity in that the spike directionality was on average more than twice as large as the directionality of the postsynaptic potentials (PSPs). We then show that, in our sample of IC cells, PSP directional selectivity is not created de novo. Rather, we found that the preferred and null FMs evoked synaptic conductances of different magnitudes, indicating that the presynaptic neurons were directionally selective. Combining conductance data with modeling, we show that directionally dependent magnitude differences, not temporal differences, underlie PSP directionality. Modeling also shows that our results are consistent with extracellular studies in which blocking inhibition reduces or eliminates directionality. Our findings suggest that some IC cells use a rate code in their inputs rather than a time code and that highly selective discharge properties can be created by only minor adjustments in the synaptic strengths evoked by different signals.},

abstract = {Neurons and synapses display a rich range of time-dependent processes. Which of these are critical to understanding specific integrative functions in the brain? Computational methods of various kinds are used to understand how systems of neurons interact to produce behavior. However, these models often assume that neuronal dynamics and synaptic strengths are fixed. This review presents some recent models that illustrate that short-term synaptic plasticity mechanisms such as facilitation and depression can have important implications for network function. Other features of synaptic transmission such as multi-component synaptic potentials, cotransmission, and neuromodulation with obvious potential computational implications are presented. These examples illustrate that synaptic strength and intrinsic properties in networks are continuously varying on numerous time scales as a function of the temporal patterns of activity in the network. Thus, both firing frequency of the neurons in a circuit, and the modulatory environment determine the intrinsic and synaptic properties that produce behavior.},

We determine the statistics of the output spike train of a biophysical model neuron as a function of the mean and variance of the fluctuating current, when the current is white noise, or when it derives from Poisson trains of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic conductances. In the first case, the firing rate increases with increasing Variance of the current, whereas in the latter case it decreases. In contrast, the firing rate is independent of variance (for constant mean) in the commonly used random walk, and perfect integrate-and-fire models for spike generation. The model neuron can be in the current-dominated state, representative of neurons in the in vitro slice preparation, or in the fluctuation-dominate state, representative of in vivo neurons.

title = {Using complicated, wide dynamic range driving to develop models of single neurons in single recording sessions},
abstract = {Neuron models are typically built by measuring individually, for each membrane conductance, its parameters (e.g., half-maximal voltages) and maximal conductance value (g(max)). However, neurons have extended morphologies with nonuniform conductance distributions, whereas models generally contain at most a few compartments. Both the original conductance measurements and the models therefore unavoidably contain error due to the electrical filtering of neurons and the differential placement of conductances on them. Model parameters (typically g(max) values) are therefore generally altered by hand or brute force to match model and neuron activity. We propose an alternative method in which complicated, rapidly changing driving input is used to optimize model parameters. This method also ensures that neuron and model dynamics match across a wide dynamic range, a test not performed in most modeling. We tested this concept using leech heartbeat and generic tonically firing models and lobster stomatogastric and generic bursting models as targets and g(max) values as optimized parameters. In all four cases optimization solutions excellently matched target activity. Complicated, wide dynamic range driving thus appears to be an excellent method to characterize neuron properties in detail and to build highly accurate models. In these completely defined targets, the method found each target's 8-13 g(max) values with high accuracy, and may therefore also provide an alternative, functionally based method of defining neuron g(max) values. The method uses only standard experimental and computational techniques, could be easily extended to optimize conductance parameters other than g(max), and should be readily applicable to real neurons.},

abstract = {Microcircuits in different brain areas share similar architectural and biophysical properties with compact motor networks known as central pattern generators (CPGs). Consequently, CPGs have been suggested as valuable biological models for understanding of microcircuit dynamics and particularly, their synchronization. We use a well known compact motor network, the lobster pyloric CPG to study principles of intercircuit synchronization. We couple separate pyloric circuits obtained from two animals via artificial synapses and observe how their synchronization depends on the topology and kinetic parameters of the computer-generated synapses. Stable in-phase synchronization appears when electrically coupling the pacemaker groups of the two networks, but reciprocal inhibitory connections produce more robust and regular cooperative activity. Contralateral inhibitory connections offer effective synchronization and flexible setting of the burst phases of the interacting networks. We also show that a conductance-based mathematical model of the coupled circuits correctly reproduces the observed dynamics illustrating the generality of the phenomena.},

title = {Fitting experimental data to models that use morphological data from public databases},
abstract = {Ideally detailed neuron models should make use of morphological and electrophysiological data from the same cell. However, this rarely happens. Typically a modeler will choose a cell morphology from a public database, assign standard values for Ra, Cm, and other parameters and then do the modeling study. The assumption is that the model will produce results representative of what might be obtained experimentally. To test this assumption we developed models of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons using 4 different morphologies obtained from 3 public databases. The multiple run fitter in NEURON was used to fit parameter values in each of the 4 morphological models to match experimental data recorded from 19 CA1 pyramidal cells. Fits with fixed standard parameter values produced results that were generally not representative of our experimental data. However, when parameter values were allowed to vary, excellent fits were obtained in almost all cases, but the fitted parameter values were very different among the 4 reconstructions and did not match standard values. The differences in fitted values can be explained by very different diameters, total lengths, membrane areas and volumes among the reconstructed cells, reflecting either cell heterogeneity or issues with the reconstruction data. The fitted values compensated for these differences to make the database cells and experimental cells more similar electrotonically. We conclude that models using fully reconstructed morphologies need to be calibrated with experimental data (even when morphological and electrophysiological data come from the same cell), model results should be generated with multiple reconstructions, morphological and experimental cells should come from the same strain of animal at the same age, and blind use of standard parameter values in models that use reconstruction data may not produce representative experimental results.},

abstract = {We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vitro to investigate the integration of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) by applying synthetic synaptic input patterns with dynamic clamping. We explored an input regime in which excitation and inhibition had an ongoing baseline rate because both input pathways show ongoing activity in vivo. We found that spiking was time-locked to transients in the inputs, consisting of brief decreases in inhibitory or increases in excitatory conductance. Such input transients were caused by synchronization among multiple inputs. However, we found that temporal synchrony in the inhibitory input pathway had preferential access to the control of DCN spiking, because the large NMDA component of the excitatory inputs smoothed out temporal transients in this pathway. Thus, synaptic integration in the DCN appears to be tuned to allow the cerebellar cortical output from Purkinje cells preferential access to the control of DCN spiking. The effect of temporal modulations in the inhibition was further enhanced by the voltage dependence of the NMDA inputs. Thus, the presence of a baseline of mossy and climbing fiber inputs boosted depolarizing responses caused by reduced inhibition by the voltage-dependent increase in inward NMDA current. Overall, our results show that correlated activity or pauses in populations of Purkinje cells are well suited to the dynamic control of DCN spiking. In addition, strong transients in excitation can directly drive DCN responses that bypass cerebellar cortical processing.},

title = {Contributions of receptor desensitization and saturation to plasticity at the retinogeniculate synapse},
abstract = {The retinogeniculate synapse conveys visual information from the retina to thalamic relay neurons. Here, we examine the mechanisms of short-term plasticity that can influence transmission at this connection in mouse brain slices. Our studies show that synaptic strength is modified by physiological activity patterns due to marked depression at high frequencies. Postsynaptic mechanisms of plasticity make prominent contributions to this synaptic depression. During trains of retinal input stimulation, receptor desensitization attenuates the AMPA EPSC while the NMDA EPSC saturates. This differential plasticity may help explain the distinct roles of these receptors in shaping the relay neuron response to visual stimulation with the AMPA component being important for transient responses, while sustained high frequency responses rely more on the NMDA component.},

title = {Bridge balance in intracellular recording; introduction of the phase-sensitive method},
abstract = {Passing current through the microelectrode during intracellular recording produces an artifactual voltage-drop across the electrode's resistance. In modern biological amplifiers, the means of removing this artifact is through what is no more than an analog arithmetic unit which subtracts a voltage, having some fixed proportion to the current being injected, from the voltage appearing at the input to the amplifier. Various techniques have evolved for determining that fixed proportion, an operation which has come to be referred to as bridge balance, and these are reviewed. A new method is presented for determining bridge balance and another amplifier parameter which affects current injection, capacitance neutralization. Essentially, a sinusoidal current is passed through the electrode and preparation at a frequency high enough so that the cellular membrane presents negligable impedance but low enough so that the electrode appears as nearly a pure resistance. A set of analytical formulations is presented which describes the system and which is useful in choosing the best frequency of the test sinusoidal signal. This choice, part of the experimental design, is based on the predicted time constants of the recorded cell and the recording electrode. In using the phase-sensitive method, the capacitance neutralization of the recording amplifier is adjusted until there is no phase error in the injected current. Bridge balance can then be adjusted until no sinusoidal signal is visible at the output of the amplifier. Both bridge balance and correction of capacitance compensation can be automatically and continuously performed during intracellular recording by incorporating a phase-sensitive alternating current (AC) voltmeter (i.e. a lock-in amplifier) into the system. This permits accurate measurement of intracellular potential during current injection even though the resistance of the electrode might be changing.},

abstract = {The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) encodes the rapid component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current (I(Kr)). Per-Arnt-Sim domain mutations of the HERG channel are linked to type 2 long-QT syndrome. We studied wild-type and/or type 2 long-QT syndrome-associated mutant (R56Q) HERG current (I(HERG)) in HEK-293 cells, at both 23 and 36 degrees C. Conventional voltage-clamp analysis revealed mutation-induced changes in channel kinetics. To assess functional implication(s) of the mutation, we introduce the dynamic action potential clamp technique. In this study, we effectively replace the native I(Kr) of a ventricular cell (either a human model cell or an isolated rabbit myocyte) with I(HERG) generated in a HEK-293 cell that is voltage-clamped by the free-running action potential of the ventricular cell. Action potential characteristics of the ventricular cells were effectively reproduced with wild-type I(HERG), whereas the R56Q mutation caused a frequency-dependent increase of the action potential duration in accordance with the clinical phenotype. The dynamic action potential clamp approach also revealed a frequency-dependent transient wild-type I(HERG) component, which is absent with R56Q channels. This novel electrophysiological technique allows rapid and unambiguous determination of the effects of an ion channel mutation on the ventricular action potential and can serve as a new tool for investigating cardiac channelopathies.},

title = {Electrophysiology of guinea-pig cerebellar nuclear cells in the in vitro brain stem-cerebellar preparation},
abstract = {1. Intracellular recordings were obtained from cerebellar nuclear neurones in the isolated brain stem-cerebellar preparation of guinea-pigs in vitro. The electrical properties of the cells were quite similar to those reported in in vitro slice studies. They had an average resting potential of -56.7 +/- 1.8 mV, an input resistance of 23.8 +/- 4.9 M omega, and a time constant of 12.5 +/- 2.7 ms. The action potentials had an average amplitude of 57.3 +/- 5.28 mV (n = 20). 2. In addition to the ionic mechanisms required for the generation of the fast action potential, cerebellar nuclear neurones displayed a low-threshold Ca2+-dependent spike which produced a powerful rebound excitation following anodal break. This type of electroresponsiveness was absent in the slice preparation. 3. The anodal break response was further enhanced by the presence of a non-inactivating Na+ conductance similar to that described in Purkinje cells. 4. Following electrical stimulation of the cerebellar cortex or the underlying white matter, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic potentials (EPSP-IPSP sequences) could be recorded in cerebellar nuclear neurones. The EPSPs were elicited by direct activation of collaterals of mossy or climbing fibre afferents. The IPSPs followed direct or orthodromic Purkinje cell activation. 5. The integrity of the olivo-cerebellar system was tested by the administration of harmaline which produced powerful EPSP-IPSP sequences or pure IPSPs in cerebellar nuclear neurones. These IPSPs were often followed by a rebound firing of the cells. 6. These results indicate that the olivo-cerebellar pathway, in addition to its activation of the cerebellar cortex, exerts a powerful and complex set of synaptic events on cerebellar nuclear cells. As such it is a true afferent system, having a distinct role in cerebellar physiology.},

abstract = {Neurotransmission during development regulates synaptic maturation in neural circuits, but the contribution of different neurotransmitter systems is unclear. We investigated the role of GABAA receptor-mediated Cl- conductances in the development of synaptic responses in the Xenopus visual system. Intracellular Cl- concentration ([Cl-]i) was found to be high in immature tectal neurons and then falls over a period of several weeks. GABAergic synapses are present at early stages of tectal development and, when activated by optic nerve stimulation or visual stimuli, induce sustained depolarizing Cl- conductances that facilitate retinotectal transmission by NMDA receptors. To test whether depolarizing GABAergic inputs cooperate with NMDA receptors during activity-dependent maturation of glutamatergic synapses, we prematurely reduced [Cl-]i in tectal neurons in vivo by expressing the Cl- transporter KCC2. This blocked the normal developmental increase in AMPA receptor-mediated retinotectal transmission and increased GABAergic synaptic input to tectal neurons. Therefore, depolarizing GABAergic transmission plays a pivotal role in the maturation of excitatory transmission and controls the balance of excitation and inhibition in the developing retinotectal circuit.},

title = {What role do pacemakers play in the generation of respiratory rhythm?},
abstract = {The pacemaker hypothesis that specialized neurons with conditional oscillatory- bursting properties are obligatory for respiratory rhythm generation in vitro has gained widespread acceptance, despite lack of direct proof. Here we critique the pacemaker hypothesis and provide an alternative explanation for rhythmogenesis based on emergent network properties. Pacemaker neurons in the preB{\"o}tC depend on either persistent Na+ current I(NaP) or Ca(2+)-activated nonspecific cationic current (I(CAN)). Activity in slice preparations and synaptically- isolated pacemaker neurons undergo similar frequency modulation by perturbations including hypoxia and changes in external K+. These data have been used to argue that pacemaker cells must be rhythmogenic, but may simply reflect the action of these perturbations on intrinsic membrane properties throughout the preB{\"o}tC and does not constitute proof that pacemakers necessarily drive the rhythm with synaptic coupling in place. Likewise, bath-applied drugs, such as riluzole (RIL) and flufenamic acid (FFA), attenuate I(NaP) and I(CAN), respectively, throughout the slice. Thus, when these drugs stop the rhythm, a widespread depression of excitability is likely the underlying cause, not selective blockade of bursting-pacemaker activity. We propose that rhythmogenesis is an emergent network property, wherein recurrent synaptic excitation initiates a positive feedback cycle among interneurons and that intrinsic currents like I(CAN) and I(NaP) promote inspiratory burst generation by augmenting synaptic excitation in the context of network activity. In this group-pacemaker framework, individual pacemaker neurons can be embedded but play the same role as every other network constituent.},

abstract = {Neurons in the avian cochlear nucleus are depolarized by GABAergic synaptic input. We recorded GABAergic synaptic currents using the gramicid in-perforated-patch method and found their reversal potential (V-rev) to be depolarized relative to spike threshold, which is surprising given that these inputs are inhibitory. Depolarizing IPSPs (dIPSPs) are kept below spike generation threshold by the activation of a dendrotoxin-I-sensitive, voltage-gated K+ conductance. We show experimentally that the polarity of IPSPs contributes to their efficacy; dIPSPs induce accommodation, the positive shift in spike threshold, and are therefore more strongly inhibitory than conventional, hyperpolarizing IPSPs in the same neurons. A similar inhibitory mechanism has been described in invertebrate sensory fibers and axons of dorsal root ganglion cells and may be a general means of amplifying the strength of inhibition in cases where the size of excitatory conductances greatly exceeds that of inhibitory conductances.},

In environments where data arrive sequentially, techniques such as cross validation to achieve regularization or model selection are not possible. The Bayesian approach, with extended Kalman filtering at the parameter estimation level, allows for regularization within a minimum variance framework. A multilayer perceptron is used to generate the extended Kalman filter nonlinear measurements mapping. We describe several algorithms at the noise estimation level that allow us to implement on-line regularization.

abstract = {Information processing in higher brain structures is thought to rely on the synchronization of spiking neurons. Increasing evidence indicates that, within these structures, inhibitory neurons are linked by both chemical and electrical synapses. However, how synchronized states may emerge from such circuits is not fully understood. Using snail neurons interconnected through a dynamic-clamp system, we show that networks of spiking neurons linked by both reciprocal inhibition and electrical coupling can express two coexisting coordination patterns of different rhythms. One of these patterns consists of antiphase firing of the network partners whereas, in the other, neurons fire synchronously. Switching between patterns may be evoked immediately by transient stimuli, demonstrating bistability of the network. Thus electrical coupling can provide a potent way for instantaneous reconfiguration of activity patterns in inhibitory spiking networks without alteration of intrinsic network properties by modulatory processes.},

title = {Estimating use-dependent synaptic gain in autonomic ganglia by computational simulation and dynamic-clamp analysis},
abstract = {Biological gain mechanisms regulate the sensitivity and dynamics of signaling pathways at the systemic, cellular, and molecular levels. In the sympathetic nervous system, gain in sensory-motor feedback loops is essential for homeostatic regulation of blood pressure and body temperature. This study shows how synaptic convergence and plasticity can interact to generate synaptic gain in autonomic ganglia and thereby enhance homeostatic control. Using a conductance-based computational model of an idealized sympathetic neuron, we simulated the postganglionic response to noisy patterns of presynaptic activity and found that a threefold amplification in postsynaptic spike output can arise in ganglia, depending on the number and strength of nicotinic synapses, the presynaptic firing rate, the extent of presynaptic facilitation, and the expression of muscarinic and peptidergic excitation. The simulations also showed that postsynaptic refractory periods serve to limit synaptic gain and alter postsynaptic spike timing. Synaptic gain was measured by stimulating dissociated bullfrog sympathetic neurons with 1-10 virtual synapses using a dynamic clamp. As in simulations, the threshold synaptic conductance for nicotinic excitation of firing was typically 10-15 nS, and synaptic gain increased with higher levels of nicotinic convergence. Unlike the model, gain in neurons sometimes declined during stimulation. This postsynaptic effect was partially blocked by 10 microM Cd2+, which inhibits voltage-dependent calcium currents. These results support a general model in which the circuit variations observed in parasympathetic and sympathetic ganglia, as well as other neural relays, can enable functional subsets of neurons to behave either as 1:1 relays, variable amplifiers, or switches.},

title = {Contributions of intrinsic motor neuron properties to the production of rhythmic motor output in the mammalian spinal cord},
abstract = {Motor neurons are endowed with intrinsic and conditional membrane properties that may shape the final motor output. In the first half of this paper we present data on the contribution of I(h), a hyperpolarization-activated inward cation current, to phase-transition in motor neurons during rhythmic firing. Motor neurons were recorded intracellularly during locomotion induced with a mixture of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and serotonin, after pharmacological blockade of I(h). I(h) was then replaced by using dynamic clamp, a computer program that allows artificial conductances to be inserted into real neurons. I(h) was simulated with biophysical parameters determined in voltage clamp experiments. The data showed that electronic replacement of the native I(h) caused a depolarization of the average membrane potential, a phase-advance of the locomotor drive potential, and increased motor neuron spiking. Introducing an artificial leak conductance could mimic all of these effects. The observed effects on phase-advance and firing, therefore, seem to be secondary to the tonic depolarization; i.e., I(h) acts as a tonic leak conductance during locomotion. In the second half of this paper we discuss recent data showing that the neonatal rat spinal cord can produce a stable motor rhythm in the absence of spike activity in premotor interneuronal networks. These coordinated motor neuron oscillations are dependent on NMDA-evoked pacemaker properties, which are synchronized across gap junctions. We discuss the functional relevance for such coordinated oscillations in immature and mature spinal motor systems.},

title = {Inhibitory control at a synaptic relay},
abstract = {The mammalian medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) harbors one of the most powerful terminals in the CNS, the calyx of Held. The mechanisms known to regulate this synaptic relay are relatively ineffective. Here, we report the presence of a remarkably robust and fast-acting glycinergic inhibitory system capable of suppressing calyceal transmission. Evoked glycinergic IPSCs were relatively small in 2-week-old rats, an age by which calyceal maturation has reportedly neared completion. However, by postnatal day 25 (P25), glycinergic transmission had undergone a vigorous transformation, resulting in peak synaptic conductances as high as 280 nS. These are comparable with glutamatergic conductances activated by calyceal inputs. Decay kinetics for IPSCs were severalfold faster than for glycinergic synaptic events reported previously. At physiological temperatures in P25 rats, IPSCs decayed in approximately 1 msec and could be elicited at frequencies up to 500 Hz. Moreover, EPSPs triggered by glutamatergic signals derived from the calyx or simulated by conductance clamp were suppressed when preceded by simulated glycinergic IPSPs. The matching of excitatory transmission in the calyx of Held by a powerful, precision inhibitory system suggests that the relay function of the MNTB may be rapidly modified during sound localization.},

Simple organizing principles are required for us to make sense of this abundance of possibilities and wealth of related data. We suggest that energy minimization subject to functional constraints may be one such unifying principle. We compared the energy needed to produce action potentials singly and in trains for a wide range of channel densities and kinetic parameters and examined which combinations of parameters maximized spiking function while minimizing energetic cost. We confirmed these results for sodium channels using a dynamic current clamp in neocortical fast spiking interneurons. We find further evidence supporting this hypothesis in a wide range of other neurons from several species and conclude that the ion channels in these neurons minimize energy expenditure in their normal range of spiking.},

title = {A scriptable DSP-based system for dynamic conductance injection},
abstract = {A variety of software and hardware systems have been developed to inject controlled electrical conductances into excitable cells, to investigate the physiological mechanisms of action potential generation. These systems face several challenges: the need to model complex conductances, including voltage-gated ion channels, synaptic conductances controlled by electrical models of entire cells or even networks of cells, to do so rapidly and stably, with precisely controlled update intervals of 20micros or less, and to present an easy and flexible interface to the user, allowing new experiments to be designed and executed easily. In this paper I describe a new software system (SM-2) which is designed to meet these requirements, and which runs on the current generation of digital-signal-processing (DSP) analog input-output I/O boards, hosted in Windows PCs. Its key innovation is its configurability by simple user-written text scripts, or "scriptability", which gives it a high flexibility of purpose, and allows non-programmers the capacity to rapidly design and use new Hodgkin-Huxley-type active conductances, conductances with arbitrary current-voltage relationships, Markov process conductance mechanisms with user-specified rate matrices, and hybrid networks of virtual cells. At the same time, the hardware platform allows this to be achieved with a fast and accurately timed input-computation-output cycle.},

In the present study, by using a brain slice preparation, we tested the hypothesis that these changes in synaptic transmission would degrade the transmission of timing information from the ANF to the AVCN bushy neuron. We show that the electrical excitability of bushy cells in hearing-impaired old DBA mice was different from that in young, normal-hearing DBA mice. We found an increase in the action potential (AP) firing threshold with current injection; a larger AP afterhyperpolarization; and an increase in the number of spikes produced by large depolarizing currents. We also tested the temporal precision of bushy cell responses to high-frequency stimulation of the ANF. The standard deviation of spikes (spike jitter) produced by ANF-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) was largely unaffected in old DBA mice. However, spike entrainment during a 100-Hz volley of EPSPs was significantly reduced. This was not a limitation of the ability of bushy cells to fire APs at this stimulus frequency, because entrainment to trains of current pulses was unaffected. Moreover, the decrease in entrainment is not attributable to increased synaptic depression. Surprisingly, the spike latency was 0.46 ms shorter in old DBA mice, and was apparently attributable to a faster conduction velocity, since the evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) latency was shorter in old DBA mice as well. We also tested the contribution of the low-voltage-activated K+ conductance (g (KLV)) on the spike latency by using dynamic clamp. Alteration in g (KLV) had little effect on the spike latency. To test whether these changes in DBA mice were simply a result of continued postnatal maturation, we repeated the experiments in CBA mice, a strain that shows normal hearing thresholds through this age range. CBA mice exhibited no reduction in entrainment or increased spike jitter with age. We conclude that the ability of AVCN bushy neurons to reliably follow ANF EPSPs is compromised in a frequency-dependent fashion in hearing-impaired mice. This effect can be best explained by an increase in spike threshold.},

title = {Diversity of intrinsic frequency encoding patterns in rat cortical neurons--mechanisms and possible functions},
abstract = {Extracellular recordings of single neurons in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices of monkeys in vivo have shown that their firing rate can increase, decrease, or remain constant in different cells, as the external stimulus frequency increases. We observed similar intrinsic firing patterns (increasing, decreasing or constant) in rat somatosensory cortex in vitro, when stimulated with oscillatory input using conductance injection (dynamic clamp). The underlying mechanism of this observation is not obvious, and presents a challenge for mathematical modelling. We propose a simple principle for describing this phenomenon using a leaky integrate-and-fire model with sinusoidal input, an intrinsic oscillation and Poisson noise. Additional enhancement of the gain of encoding could be achieved by local network connections amongst diverse intrinsic response patterns. Our work sheds light on the possible cellular and network mechanisms underlying these opposing neuronal responses, which serve to enhance signal detection.},

title = {Synaptic background activity controls spike transfer from thalamus to cortex},
abstract = {Characterizing the responsiveness of thalamic neurons is crucial to understanding the flow of sensory information. Typically, thalamocortical neurons possess two distinct firing modes. At depolarized membrane potentials, thalamic cells fire single action potentials and faithfully relay synaptic inputs to the cortex. At hyperpolarized potentials, the activation of T-type calcium channels promotes burst firing, and the transfer is less accurate. Our results suggest that this duality no longer holds if synaptic background activity is taken into account. By injecting stochastic conductances into guinea-pig thalamocortical neurons in slices, we show that the transfer function of these neurons is strongly influenced by conductance noise. The combination of synaptic noise with intrinsic properties gives a global responsiveness that is more linear, mixing single-spike and burst responses at all membrane potentials. Because in thalamic neurons, background synaptic input originates mainly from cortex, these results support a determinant role of corticothalamic feedback during sensory information processing.},

title = {Postsynaptic variability of firing in rat cortical neurons: The roles of input synchronization and synaptic NMDA receptor conductance},
abstract = {Neurons in the functioning cortex fire erratically, with highly variable intervals between spikes. How much irregularity comes from the process of postsynaptic integration and how much from fluctuations in synaptic input? We have addressed these questions by recording the firing of neurons in slices of rat visual cortex in which synaptic receptors are blocked pharmacologically, while injecting controlled trains of unitary conductance transients, to electrically mimic natural synaptic input. Stimulation with a Poisson train of fast excitatory (AMPA-type) conductance transients, to simulate independent inputs, produced much less variability than encountered in vivo. Addition of NMDA-type conductance to each unitary event regularized the firing but lowered the precision and reliability of spikes in repeated responses. Independent Poisson trains of GABA-type conductance transients (reversing at the resting potential), which simulated independent activity in a population of presynaptic inhibitory neurons, failed to increase timing variability substantially but increased the precision of responses. However, introduction of synchrony, or correlations, in the excitatory input, according to a nonstationary Poisson model, dramatically raised timing variability to in vivo levels. The NMDA phase of compound AMPA-NMDA events conferred a time-dependent postsynaptic variability, whereby the reliability and precision of spikes degraded rapidly over the 100 msec after the start of a synchronous input burst. We conclude that postsynaptic mechanisms add significant variability to cortical responses but that substantial synchrony of inputs is necessary to explain in vivo variability. We suggest that NMDA receptors help to implement a switch from precise firing to random firing during responses to concerted inputs.},

abstract = {We examined the kinetic properties of voltage-gated Na(+) channels and their contribution to the repetitive spiking activity of medullary raph{\'e} neurons, which exhibit slow pacemaking and strong spiking adaptation. The study is based on a combination of whole-cell patch-clamp, modeling and real-time computation. Na(+) currents were recorded from neurons in brain slices obtained from male and female neonatal rats, using voltage-clamp protocols designed to reduce space-clamp artifacts and to emphasize functionally relevant kinetic features. A detailed kinetic model was formulated to explain the broad range of transient and stationary voltage-dependent properties exhibited by Na(+) currents. The model was tested by injecting via dynamic clamp a model-based current as a substitute for the native TTX-sensitive Na(+) currents, which were pharmacologically blocked. The model-based current reproduced well the native spike shape and spiking frequency. The dynamics of Na(+) channels during repetitive spiking were indirectly examined through this model. By comparing the spiking activities generated with different kinetic models in dynamic-clamp experiments, we determined that state-dependent slow inactivation contributes significantly to spiking adaptation. Through real-time manipulation of the model-based current, we established that suprathreshold Na(+) current mainly controls spike shape, whereas subthreshold Na(+) current modulates spiking frequency and contributes to the pacemaking mechanism. Since the model-based current was injected in the soma, the results also suggest that somatic Na(+) channels are sufficient to establish the essential spiking properties of raph{\'e} neurons in vitro.},

abstract = {To determine why elements of central pattern generators phase lock in a particular pattern under some conditions but not others, we tested a theoretical pattern prediction method. The method is based on the tabulated open loop pulsatile interactions of bursting neurons on a cycle-by-cycle basis and was tested in closed loop hybrid circuits composed of one bursting biological neuron and one bursting model neuron coupled using the dynamic clamp. A total of 164 hybrid networks were formed by varying the synaptic conductances. The prediction of 1:1 phase locking agreed qualitatively with the experimental observations, except in three hybrid circuits in which 1:1 locking was predicted but not observed. Correct predictions sometimes required consideration of the second order phase resetting, which measures the change in the timing of the second burst after the perturbation. The method was robust to offsets between the initiation of bursting in the presynaptic neuron and the activation of the synaptic coupling with the postsynaptic neuron. The quantitative accuracy of the predictions fell within the variability (10%) in the experimentally observed intrinsic period and phase resetting curve (PRC), despite changes in the burst duration of the neurons between open and closed loop conditions.},

title = {Distinct roles of GABAergic interneurons in the regulation of striatal output pathways},
abstract = {Striatal GABAergic microcircuits are critical for motor function, yet their properties remain enigmatic due to difficulties in targeting striatal interneurons for electrophysiological analysis. Here, we use Lhx6-GFP transgenic mice to identify GABAergic interneurons and investigate their regulation of striatal direct- and indirect-pathway medium spiny neurons (MSNs). We find that the two major interneuron populations, persistent low-threshold spiking (PLTS) and fast spiking (FS) interneurons, differ substantially in their excitatory inputs and inhibitory outputs. Excitatory synaptic currents recorded from PLTS interneurons are characterized by a small, nonrectifying AMPA receptor-mediated component and a NMDA receptor-mediated component. In contrast, glutamatergic synaptic currents in FS interneurons have a large, strongly rectifying AMPA receptor-mediated component, but no detectable NMDA receptor-mediated responses. Consistent with their axonal morphology, the output of individual PLTS interneurons is relatively weak and sparse, whereas FS interneurons are robustly connected to MSNs and other FS interneurons and appear to mediate the bulk of feedforward inhibition. Synaptic depression of FS outputs is relatively insensitive to firing frequency, and dynamic-clamp experiments reveal that these short-term dynamics enable feedforward inhibition to remain efficacious across a broad frequency range. Surprisingly, we find that FS interneurons preferentially target direct-pathway MSNs over indirect-pathway MSNs, suggesting a potential mechanism for rapid pathway-specific regulation of striatal output pathways.},

Visually evoked inhibition was analyzed in 88 cells by detecting spike suppression, hyperpolarization, and reduction of trial-to-trial variability of membrane potential.

We conclude that excitatory and inhibitory inputs share the tuning preference of spiking output in 60% of cases, whereas inhibition is tuned to a different orientation in 40% of cases. For this latter type of cells, conductance measurements showed that excitation shared either the preference of the spiking output or that of the inhibition. This diversity of input combinations may reflect inhomogeneities in functional intracortical connectivity regulated by correlation-based activity-dependent processes.},

title = {Multistability in recurrent neural loops arising from delay},
abstract = {The dynamics of a recurrent inhibitory neural loop composed of a periodically spiking Aplysia motoneuron reciprocally connected to a computer are investigated as a function of the time delay, tau, for propagation around the loop. It is shown that for certain choices of tau, multiple qualitatively different neural spike trains co-exist. A mathematical model is constructed for the dynamics of this pulsed-coupled recurrent loop in which all parameters are readily measured experimentally: the phase resetting curve of the neuron for a given simulated postsynaptic current and tau. For choices of the parameters for which multiple spiking patterns co-exist in the experimental paradigm, the model exhibits multistability. Numerical simulations suggest that qualitatively similar results will occur if the motoneuron is replaced by several other types of neurons and that once tau becomes sufficiently long, multistability will be the dominant form of dynamical behavior. These observations suggest that great care must be taken in determining the etiology of qualitative changes in neural spiking patterns, particularly when propagation times around polysynaptic loops are long.},

title = {Energy integration describes sound-intensity coding in an insect auditory system},
abstract = {We investigate the transduction of sound stimuli into neural responses and focus on locust auditory receptor cells. As in other mechanosensory model systems, these neurons integrate acoustic inputs over a fairly broad frequency range. To test three alternative hypotheses about the nature of this spectral integration (amplitude, energy, pressure), we perform intracellular recordings while stimulating with superpositions of pure tones. On the basis of online data analysis and automatic feedback to the stimulus generator, we systematically explore regions in stimulus space that lead to the same level of neural activity. Focusing on such iso-firing-rate regions allows for a rigorous quantitative comparison of the electrophysiological data with predictions from the three hypotheses that is independent of nonlinearities induced by the spike dynamics. We find that the dependence of the firing rates of the receptors on the composition of the frequency spectrum can be well described by an energy-integrator model. This result holds at stimulus onset as well as for the steady-state response, including the case in which adaptation effects depend on the stimulus spectrum. Predictions of the model for the responses to bandpass-filtered noise stimuli are verified accurately. Together, our data suggest that the sound-intensity coding of the receptors can be understood as a three-step process, composed of a linear filter, a summation of the energy contributions in the frequency domain, and a firing-rate encoding of the resulting effective sound intensity. These findings set quantitative constraints for future biophysical models.},

title = {The high-conductance state of cortical networks},
abstract = {We studied the dynamics of large networks of spiking neurons with conductance-based (nonlinear) synapses and compared them to networks with current-based (linear) synapses. For systems with sparse and inhibition-dominated recurrent connectivity, weak external inputs induced asynchronous irregular firing at low rates. Membrane potentials fluctuated a few millivolts below threshold, and membrane conductances were increased by a factor 2 to 5 with respect to the resting state. This combination of parameters characterizes the ongoing spiking activity typically recorded in the cortex in vivo. Many aspects of the asynchronous irregular state in conductance-based networks could be sufficiently well characterized with a simple numerical mean field approach. In particular, it correctly predicted an intriguing property of conductance-based networks that does not appear to be shared by current-based models: they exhibit states of low-rate asynchronous irregular activity that persist for some period of time even in the absence of external inputs and without cortical pacemakers. Simulations of larger networks (up to 350,000 neurons) demonstrated that the survival time of self-sustained activity increases exponentially with network size.},

abstract = {One of the most difficult and time-consuming aspects of building compartmental models of single neurons is assigning values to free parameters to make models match experimental data. Automated parameter-search methods potentially represent a more rapid and less labor-intensive alternative to choosing parameters manually. Here we compare the performance of four different parameter-search methods on several single-neuron models. The methods compared are conjugate-gradient descent, genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and stochastic search. Each method has been tested on five different neuronal models ranging from simple models with between 3 and 15 parameters to a realistic pyramidal cell model with 23 parameters. The results demonstrate that genetic algorithms and simulated annealing are generally the most effective methods. Simulated annealing was overwhelmingly the most effective method for simple models with small numbers of parameters, but the genetic algorithm method was equally effective for more complex models with larger numbers of parameters. The discussion considers possible explanations for these results and makes several specific recommendations for the use of parameter searches on neuronal models.},

title = {Contrasting effects of the persistent Na+ current on neuronal excitability and spike timing},
abstract = {The persistent Na+ current, INaP, is known to amplify subthreshold oscillations and synaptic potentials, but its impact on action potential generation remains enigmatic. Using computational modeling, whole-cell recording, and dynamic clamp of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells in brain slices, we examined how INaP changes the transduction of excitatory current into action potentials. Model simulations predicted that INaP increases afterhyperpolarizations, and, although it increases excitability by reducing rheobase, INaP also reduces the gain in discharge frequency in response to depolarizing current (f/I gain). These predictions were experimentally confirmed by using dynamic clamp, thus circumventing the longstanding problem that INaP cannot be selectively blocked. Furthermore, we found that INaP increased firing regularity in response to sustained depolarization, although it decreased spike time precision in response to single evoked EPSPs. Finally, model simulations demonstrated that I(NaP) increased the relative refractory period and decreased interspike-interval variability under conditions resembling an active network in vivo.},

title = {Impact of network activities on neuronal properties in corticothalamic systems},
abstract = {Data from in vivo and in vitro experiments are discussed to emphasize that synaptic activities in neocortex and thalamus have a decisive impact on intrinsic neuronal properties in intact-brain preparations under anesthesia and even more so during natural states of vigilance. Thus the firing patterns of cortical neuronal types are not inflexible but may change with the level of membrane potential and during periods rich in synaptic activity. The incidences of some cortical cell classes (defined by their responses to depolarizing current pulses) are different in isolated cortical slabs in vivo or in slices maintained in vitro compared with the intact cortex of naturally awake animals. Network activities, which include the actions of generalized modulatory systems, have a profound influence on the membrane potential, apparent input resistance, and backpropagation of action potentials. The analysis of various oscillatory types leads to the conclusion that in the intact brain, there are no "pure" rhythms, generated in simple circuits, but complex wave sequences (consisting of different, low- and fast-frequency oscillations) that result from synaptic interactions in corticocortical and corticothalamic neuronal loops under the control of activating systems arising in the brain stem core or forebrain structures. As an illustration, it is shown that the neocortex governs the synchronization of network or intrinsically generated oscillations in the thalamus. The rhythmic recurrence of spike bursts and spike trains fired by thalamic and cortical neurons during states of decreased vigilance may lead to plasticity processes in neocortical neurons. If these phenomena, which may contribute to the consolidation of memory traces, are not constrained by inhibitory processes, they induce seizures in which the neocortex initiates the paroxysms and controls their thalamic reflection. The results indicate that intact-brain preparations are necessary to investigate global brain functions such as behavioral states of vigilance and paroxysmal activities.},

In common with proximal muscle activity, 94% of the task-related neurons had qualitatively similar discharge patterns for both directions of forearm movement. In many cases the flexion and extension discharge was virtually identical, but some cells had a distinct directional bias. The very few neurons which were directionally specific were located in the dentate and interpositus. Two had tonic activity well correlated to elbow angle. Task-related changes in discharge rate occurred earliest in dentate and latest in fastigial, but almost always during the period of concomitant proximal and elbow EMG changes. Correlations of phasic activity with movement velocity were uniformly weak. Many eye movement-related neurons were encountered in the fastigial, dentate and y-group nuclei. Fastigial eye cells, both bursting and tonic, tended to be highly direction specific, whereas dentate eye cells were usually omnidirectional and variable. For both arm and eye cerebellar cells, the directional preferences of phasic and tonic discharge, in the same neuron, could be opposed to one another.},

abstract = {In this methodological study we present a new version of a Kalman filter technique to estimate high-dimensional time-variant (tv) multivariate autoregressive (tvMVAR) models. It is based on an extension of the state-space model for a multivariate time series to a matrix-state-space model for multi-trial multivariate time series. The result is a general linear Kalman filter (GLKF). The GLKF enables a tvMVAR model estimation which was applied for interaction analysis of simulated data and high-dimensional multi-trial laser-evoked brain potentials (LEP). The tv partial Granger causality index (tvpGCI) was used to investigate the interaction patterns between LEPs derived from an experiment with noxious laser stimulation. First, the new approach was compared with the multi-trial version of the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm with forgetting factor (Moller et al., 2001) by using 24 distinct electrodes. The RLS failed for a channel number (dimension) higher than 24. Secondly, the analysis was repeated by using all 58 electrodes and the similarities and differences of the GCI-based interaction patterns are discussed. It can be demonstrated that the application of high-dimensional tvMVAR modelling will contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between structure and function.},

abstract = {The sequential firing of neurons in central pattern generators (CPGs) is generally thought to be a result of an interaction between intrinsic cellular and synaptic properties of the component neurons. Due to experimental limitations, it is usually difficult to address the role of each of these properties separately. We have done so by using the crustacean stomatogastric CPG and the dynamic clamp technique to measure how the network responds to the selective modification of an individual important synapse. Our results show that the burst periods and the phase lags between the constrictor (LP) and dilator (PD) neurons across preparations showed significant variability during equivalent experimental manipulations. Despite this variability, the ratio between the change in the burst period and the change in the phase lag between the same neurons was tightly preserved in all preparations, revealing a dynamical invariant in the system. This dynamical invariant was preserved despite the individual variability in the period and phase lag measurements, suggesting a tightly regulated constraint between the parameters of the network.},

title = {Fluctuating synaptic conductances recreate in vivo-like activity in neocortical neurons},
abstract = {To investigate the basis of the fluctuating activity present in neocortical neurons in vivo, we have combined computational models with whole-cell recordings using the dynamic-clamp technique. A simplified 'point-conductance' model was used to represent the currents generated by thousands of stochastically releasing synapses. Synaptic activity was represented by two independent fast glutamatergic and GABAergic conductances described by stochastic random-walk processes. An advantage of this approach is that all the model parameters can be determined from voltage-clamp experiments. We show that the point-conductance model captures the amplitude and spectral characteristics of the synaptic conductances during background activity. To determine if it can recreate in vivo-like activity, we injected this point-conductance model into a single-compartment model, or in rat prefrontal cortical neurons in vitro using dynamic clamp. This procedure successfully recreated several properties of neurons intracellularly recorded in vivo, such as a depolarized membrane potential, the presence of high-amplitude membrane potential fluctuations, a low-input resistance and irregular spontaneous firing activity. In addition, the point-conductance model could simulate the enhancement of responsiveness due to background activity.We conclude that many of the characteristics of cortical neurons in vivo can be explained by fast glutamatergic and GABAergic conductances varying stochastically.},

title = {Extracellular activation and membrane conductances of neurones in the guinea-pig deep cerebellar nuclei in vitro},
abstract = {The responses of cerebellar nuclear cells to extracellular stimulation in a slice preparation were studied and the ionic basis of their electroresponsiveness was investigated with blockers of membrane conductances and with ion substitutions in the extracellular medium. The cells could be activated antidromically from the cerebellar cortex and the white matter surrounding the nuclei. The dominating response to orthodromic stimulation was an inhibitory synaptic potential presumably produced by activation of Purkinje cell fibres. The action potentials and the subthreshold spikelets were shown to be Na+ dependent and are presumably generated by a voltage-dependent inactivating Na+ conductance. Plateau potentials with a low threshold were also Na+ dependent, but these long-lasting potentials are probably produced by activation of a voltage-dependent non-inactivating Na+ conductance. Plateau potentials with a high threshold and high-threshold spikelets were Ca2+ dependent and seem to be generated by non-inactivating and possibly inactivating Ca2+ conductances. The spike after-hyperpolarizations had an early voltage-dependent K+ component and a late Ca2+-dependent K+ component. They are therefore produced by voltage-sensitive and Ca2+-dependent K+ conductances. By analogy with the distribution of conductances in Purkinje cells it is proposed that the Na+ conductances are mainly located in the somatic and axonal membrane and that the Ca2+ conductances are located in the dendrites. The functional implications of the complex electroresponsive properties of cerebellar nuclear cells are discussed.},

title = {Artificial electrotonic coupling affects neuronal firing patterns depending upon cellular characteristics},
abstract = {While there have been numerous theoretical studies indicating that electrotonic coupling via gap junctions interacts with the intrinsic characteristics of the coupled neurons to modify their electrical behaviour, little experimental evidence has been provided in coupled mammalian neurons. Using an artificial electrotonic junction, two distant uncoupled neurons were coupled through the computer, and the coupling conductance was varied. Tonically firing CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons reduced their spike firing frequency when coupled to thalamic or pyramidal cells, showing that the electrical coupling can be considered as a low-pass filter. The strength of coupling needed to entrain spike bursts of pyramidal neurons was considerably lower than the coupling needed to synchronize two neurons with different cellular characteristics (thalamic and pyramidal cells). Coupling promoted burst firing in a non-bursting cell if it was coupled to a spontaneously bursting neuron. These results support modelling studies that indicate a role for gap-junctional coupling in the synchronization of neuronal firing and the expression of low-frequency bursting. (C) 2001 IBRO.

abstract = {Neural data are inevitably contaminated by noise. When such noisy data are subjected to statistical analysis, misleading conclusions can be reached. Here we attempt to address this problem by applying a state-space smoothing method, based on the combined use of the Kalman filter theory and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, to denoise two datasets of local field potentials recorded from monkeys performing a visuomotor task. For the first dataset, it was found that the analysis of the high gamma band (60-90 Hz) neural activity in the prefrontal cortex is highly susceptible to the effect of noise, and denoising leads to markedly improved results that were physiologically interpretable. For the second dataset, Granger causality between primary motor and primary somatosensory cortices was not consistent across two monkeys and the effect of noise was suspected. After denoising, the discrepancy between the two subjects was significantly reduced.},

title = {A modified cable formalism for modeling neuronal membranes at high frequencies},
abstract = {Intracellular recordings of cortical neurons in vivo display intense subthreshold membrane potential (V(m)) activity. The power spectral density of the V(m) displays a power-law structure at high frequencies (>50 Hz) with a slope of approximately -2.5. This type of frequency scaling cannot be accounted for by traditional models, as either single-compartment models or models based on reconstructed cell morphologies display a frequency scaling with a slope close to -4. This slope is due to the fact that the membrane resistance is short-circuited by the capacitance for high frequencies, a situation which may not be realistic. Here, we integrate nonideal capacitors in cable equations to reflect the fact that the capacitance cannot be charged instantaneously. We show that the resulting nonideal cable model can be solved analytically using Fourier transforms. Numerical simulations using a ball-and-stick model yield membrane potential activity with similar frequency scaling as in the experiments. We also discuss the consequences of using nonideal capacitors on other cellular properties such as the transmission of high frequencies, which is boosted in nonideal cables, or voltage attenuation in dendrites. These results suggest that cable equations based on nonideal capacitors should be used to capture the behavior of neuronal membranes at high frequencies.},

title = {Impact of correlated synaptic input on output firing rate and variability in simple neuronal models},
abstract = {Cortical neurons are typically driven by thousands of synaptic inputs. The arrival of a spike from one input may or may not be correlated with the arrival of other spikes from different inputs. How does this interdependence alter the probability that the postsynaptic neuron will fire? We constructed a simple random walk model in which the membrane potential of a target neuron fluctuates stochastically, driven by excitatory and inhibitory spikes arriving at random times. An analytic expression was derived for the mean output firing rate as a function of the firing rates and pairwise correlations of the inputs. This stochastic model made three quantitative predictions. (1) Correlations between pairs of excitatory or inhibitory inputs increase the fluctuations in synaptic drive, whereas correlations between excitatory-inhibitory pairs decrease them. (2) When excitation and inhibition are fully balanced (the mean net synaptic drive is zero), firing is caused by the fluctuations only. (3) In the balanced case, firing is irregular. These theoretical predictions were in excellent agreement with simulations of an integrate-and-fire neuron that included multiple conductances and received hundreds of synaptic inputs. The results show that, in the balanced regime, weak correlations caused by signals shared among inputs may have a multiplicative effect on the input-output rate curve of a postsynaptic neuron, i.e. they may regulate its gain; in the unbalanced regime, correlations may increase firing probability mainly around threshold, when output rate is low; and in all cases correlations are expected to increase the variability of the output spike train.},

title = {Response sensitivity of barrel neuron subpopulations to simulated thalamic input},
abstract = {Our goal is to examine the relationship between neuron- and network-level processing in the context of a well-studied cortical function, the processing of thalamic input by whisker-barrel circuits in rodent neocortex. Here we focus on neuron-level processing and investigate the responses of excitatory and inhibitory barrel neurons to simulated thalamic inputs applied using the dynamic clamp method in brain slices. Simulated inputs are modeled after real thalamic inputs recorded in vivo in response to brief whisker deflections. Our results suggest that inhibitory neurons require more input to reach firing threshold, but then fire earlier, with less variability, and respond to a broader range of inputs than do excitatory neurons. Differences in the responses of barrel neuron subtypes depend on their intrinsic membrane properties. Neurons with a low input resistance require more input to reach threshold but then fire earlier than neurons with a higher input resistance, regardless of the neuron's classification. Our results also suggest that the response properties of excitatory versus inhibitory barrel neurons are consistent with the response sensitivities of the ensemble barrel network. The short response latency of inhibitory neurons may serve to suppress ensemble barrel responses to asynchronous thalamic input. Correspondingly, whereas neurons acting as part of the barrel circuit in vivo are highly selective for temporally correlated thalamic input, excitatory barrel neurons acting alone in vitro are less so. These data suggest that network-level processing of thalamic input in barrel cortex depends on neuron-level processing of the same input by excitatory and inhibitory barrel neurons.},

abstract = {The cerebral cortex is organized so that an important component of feedback input from higher to lower cortical areas arrives at the distal apical tufts of pyramidal neurons. Yet, distal inputs are predicted to have much less impact on firing than proximal inputs. Here we show that even weak asynchronous dendritic input to the distal tuft region can significantly increase the gain of layer 5 pyramidal neurons and thereby the output of columns in the primary somatosensory cortex of the rat. Noisy currents injected in ramps at different dendritic locations showed that the initial slope of the frequency-current (f/I) relationship increases with the distance of the current injection from the soma. The increase was due to the interaction of dendritic depolarization with back-propagating APs which activated dendritic calcium conductances. Gain increases were accompanied by a change of firing mode from isolated spikes to bursting where the timing of bursts coded the presence of coincident somatic and dendritic inputs. We propose that this dendritic gain modulation and the timing of bursts may serve to associate top-down and bottom-up input on different time scales.},

title = {Responses of a bursting pacemaker to excitation reveal spatial segregation between bursting and spiking mechanisms},
abstract = {Central pattern generators (CPGs) frequently include bursting neurons that serve as pacemakers for rhythm generation. Phase resetting curves (PRCs) can provide insight into mechanisms underlying phase locking in such circuits. PRCs were constructed for a pacemaker bursting complex in the pyloric circuit in the stomatogastric ganglion of the lobster and crab. This complex is comprised of the Anterior Burster (AB) neuron and two Pyloric Dilator (PD) neurons that are all electrically coupled. Artificial excitatory synaptic conductance pulses of different strengths and durations were injected into one of the AB or PD somata using the Dynamic Clamp. Previously, we characterized the inhibitory PRCs by assuming a single slow process that enabled synaptic inputs to trigger switches between an up state in which spiking occurs and a down state in which it does not. Excitation produced five different PRC shapes, which could not be explained with such a simple model. A separate dendritic compartment was required to separate the mechanism that generates the up and down phases of the bursting envelope (1) from synaptic inputs applied at the soma, (2) from axonal spike generation and (3) from a slow process with a slower time scale than burst generation. This study reveals that due to the nonlinear properties and compartmentalization of ionic channels, the response to excitation is more complex than inhibition.},

title = {On the Initiation and Propagation of Dendritic Spikes in CA1 Pyramidal Neurons},
abstract = {Under certain conditions, regenerative voltage spikes can be initiated locally in the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. These are interesting events that could potentially provide neurons with additional computational abilities. Using whole-cell dendritic recordings from the distal apical trunk and proximal tuft regions and realistic computer modeling, we have determined that highly synchronized and moderately clustered inputs are required for dendritic spike initiation: [~]50 synaptic inputs spread over 100 {micro}m of the apical trunk/tuft need to be activated within 3 msec. Dendritic spikes are characterized by a more depolarized voltage threshold than at the soma [-48 {+/-} 1 mV (n = 30) vs -56 {+/-} 1 mV (n = 7), respectively] and are mainly generated and shaped by dendritic Na+ and K+ currents. The relative contribution of AMPA and NMDA currents is also important in determining the actual spatiotemporal requirements for dendritic spike initiation. Once initiated, dendritic spikes can easily reach the soma, but their propagation is only moderately strong, so that it can be modulated by physiologically relevant factors such as changes in the Vm and the ionic composition of the extracellular solution. With effective spike propagation, an extremely short-latency neuronal output is produced for greatly reduced input levels. Therefore, dendritic spikes function as efficient detectors of specific input patterns, ensuring that the neuronal response to high levels of input synchrony is a precisely timed action potential output.},

abstract = {Vetter, Philipp, Arnd Roth, and Michael Hausser. Propagation of Action Potentials in Dendrites Depends on Dendritic Morphology. J. Neurophysiol. 85: 926-937, 2001. Action potential propagation links information processing in different regions of the dendritic tree. To examine the contribution of dendritic morphology to the efficacy of propagation, simulations were performed in detailed reconstructions of eight different neuronal types. With identical complements of voltage-gated channels, different dendritic morphologies exhibit distinct patterns of propagation. Remarkably, the range of backpropagation efficacies observed experimentally can be reproduced by the variations in dendritic morphology alone. Dendritic geometry also determines the extent to which modulation of channel densities can affect propagation. Thus in Purkinje cells and dopamine neurons, backpropagation is relatively insensitive to changes in channel densities, whereas in pyramidal cells, backpropagation can be modulated over a wide range. We also demonstrate that forward propagation of dendritically initiated action potentials is influenced by morphology in a similar manner. We show that these functional consequences of the differences in dendritic geometries can be explained quantitatively using simple anatomical measures of dendritic branching patterns, which are captured in a reduced model of dendritic geometry. These findings indicate that differences in dendritic geometry act in concert with differences in voltage-gated channel density and kinetics to generate the diversity in dendritic action potential propagation observed between neurons. They also suggest that changes in dendritic geometry during development and plasticity will critically affect propagation. By determining the spatial pattern of action potential signaling, dendritic morphology thus helps to define the size and interdependence of functional compartments in the neuron.},

title = {Mechanisms of oscillation in dynamic clamp constructed two-cell half-center circuits},
abstract = {1. The dynamic clamp was used to create reciprocally inhibitory two-cell circuits from pairs of pharmacologically isolated gastric mill neurons of the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab, Cancer borealis. 2. We used this system to study how systematic alterations in intrinsic and synaptic parameters affected the network behavior. This has previously only been possible in purely computational systems. 3. In the absence of additional hyperpolarization-activated inward current (IH), stable half-center oscillatory behavior was not observed. In the presence of additional IH, a variety of circuit dynamics, including stable half-center oscillatory activity, was produced. 4. Stable half-center behavior requires that the synaptic threshold lie within the voltage envelope of the slow wave oscillation. 5. Changes in the synaptic threshold produce dramatic changes in half-center period. As predicted by previous theoretical work, when the synaptic threshold is depolarized, the period first increases and then decreases in a characteristic inverted U-shaped relationship. Analysis of the currents responsible for the transition between the active and inhibited neurons shows that the mechanism of oscillation changes as the synaptic threshold is varied. 6. Increasing the time constant and the conductance of the inhibitory synaptic current increased the period of the half-center oscillator. 7. Increasing the conductance of IH or changing the voltage dependence of IH can either increase or decrease network period, depending on the initial mode of network oscillation. A depolarization of the activation curve causes the network to respond in a similar fashion as increasing the conductance of IH. 8. Many neuromodulatory substances are known to alter synaptic strength and the conductance and voltage dependence of IH, parameters we studied with the dynamic clamp. To understand the response of the network to modulation of a single parameter, it is necessary to understand the nature of the altered conductance and how it interacts with the other conductances in the system.},

title = {Pyramidal cell communication within local networks in layer 2/3 of rat neocortex},
abstract = {The extent to which neocortical pyramidal cells function as a local network is determined by the strength and probability of their connections. By mapping connections between pyramidal cells we show here that in a local network of about 600 pyramidal cells located within a cylindrical volume of 200 microm x 200 microm of neocortical layer 2/3, an individual pyramidal cell receives synaptic inputs from about 30 other pyramidal neurons, with the majority of EPSP amplitudes in the 0.2-1.0 mV range. The probability of connection decreased from 0.09 to 0.01 with intercell distance (over the range 25-200 microm). Within the same volume, local interneuron (fast-spiking non-accommodating interneuron, FS)-pyramidal cell connections were about 10 times more numerous, with the majority of connections being reciprocal. The probability of excitatory and inhibitory connections between pyramidal cells and FS interneurons decreased only slightly with distance, being in the range 0.5-0.75. Pyramidal cells in the local network received strong synaptic input during stimulation of afferent fibres in layers 1 and 6. Minimal-like stimulation of layer 1 or layer 6 inputs simultaneously induced postsynaptic potentials in connected pyramidal cells as well as in pyramidal-FS cell pairs. These inputs readily induced firing of pyramidal cells, although synaptically connected cells displayed different firing patterns. Unitary EPSPs in pyramidal-pyramidal cell pairs did not detectably alter cell firing. FS interneurons fire simultaneously with pyramidal cells. In pyramidal-FS cell pairs, both unitary EPSPs and IPSPs efficiently modulated cell firing patterns. We suggest that computation in the local network may proceed not only by direct pyramidal-pyramidal cell communication but also via local interneurons. With such a high degree of connectivity with surrounding pyramidal cells, local interneurons are ideally poised to both coordinate and expand the local pyramidal cell network via pyramidal-interneuron-pyramidal communication.},

title = {Models of subthreshold membrane resonance in neocortical neurons},
abstract = {1. We obtained whole cell data from sensorimotor cortical neurons of in vitro slices (juvenile rats) and observed a low-frequency resonance (1-2 Hz) in their voltage responses. We constructed models of subthreshold membrane currents to determine whether a hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I-H) is sufficient to account for this resonance. 2. Parameter values for a basic I-H (BH) model were estimated from voltage-clamp experiments at room temperature. The BH model formed a component of a reduced membrane (RM) model. On numerical integration, the RM model exhibited voltage sags and rebounds to injected current pulses; maximal voltage responses to injected oscillatory currents occurred near 2 Hz. 3. We compared the experimentally measured frequency-response curves (FRCs) at room temperature with the theoretical FRCs derived from the RM model. The theoretical FRCs exhibited resonant humps with peaks between 1 and 2 Hz. At 36 degrees C, the theoretical FRCs peaked near 10 Hz. The characteristics of theoretical and observed FRCs were in close agreement, demonstrating that I-H is sufficient to cause resonance. Thus we classified I-H as a resonator current. 4. We developed a technique, the reactive current clamp (RCC), to inject a computer-calculated current corresponding to a membrane ionic current in response to the membrane potential of the neuron. This enabled us to study the interaction of an artificial ionic current with living neurons (electronic pharmacology or EP-method). Using the RCC, a simplified version of the BH model was used to cancel an endogenous I-H (electronic antagonism) and to introduce an artificial I-H (electronic expression) when an endogenous I-H was absent. Antagonism of I-H eliminated sags and rebounds, whereas expression of I-H endowed neurons with resonance and the frequency-selective firing that accompanies resonance in neurons with an endogenous I-H. Previous investigations have relied on the specificity of pharmacological agents to block ionic channels, e.g., Cs+ to block I-H. However, Cs+ additionally affects other currents. This represents the first time an in vitro modeling technique (RCC) has been used to antagonize a specific endogenous current, I-H. 5. A simplified RM model yielded values of the resonant frequency and Q (an index of the sharpness of resonance), which rose almost linearly between -55 and -80 mV. Resonant frequencies could be much higher than f(H) = (2 pi tau H) - 1 where tau(H) is the activation time constant for I-H. 6. In the FRCs, resonance appeared as a hump at intermediate frequencies because of low- and high-frequency attenuations due to I-H and membrane capacitance, respectively. Changing the parameters of I-H altered the low-frequency attenuation and, hence, the resonance. Changes in the leak conductance affected both the low- and high-frequency attenuations. 7. We modeled an inwardly rectifying K+ current (I-IR) and a persistent Na+ current (I-NaP) to Study their effects on resonance. Neither current produced resonance in the absence of I-H. We found that I-IR attenuated, whereas I-NaP, amplified resonance. Thus I-IR and I-NaP are classified as attenuator and amplifier currents, respectively. 8. Resonators and attenuators differ in that they have longer and shorter time constants, respectively, compared with the membrane time constant. Therefore an increase in the leak conductance decreases the membrane time constant, which can transform an attenuator into a resonator, altering the frequency response; This suggests a novel mechanism for modulating the frequency responses of neurons to inputs. 9. These investigations have provided a theoretical framework for detailed understanding of mechanisms that produce resonance in cortical neurons. Resonance is one aspect of the intrinsic rhythmicity of neurons. The rhythmicity due to IH resonance is latent until it is revealed by oscillatory inputs. The rhythmicity may become evident as spontaneous oscillations near the resonant frequency if the resonance is amplified by a current such as I-NaP We suggest that t ese intrinsic properties could play a role in the propagation of coordinated rhythmic activity in central neural circuits. A specific consequence of I-H-resonance could be a stabilization of the frequency of cortical activity near 10 Hz.},

title = {Depression of inhibitory synaptic transmission between Purkinje cells and neurons of the cerebellar nuclei},
abstract = {Neurons of the cerebellar nuclei have basal firing rates of 10-20 Hz, despite the convergence of many GABAergic Purkinje terminals onto cerebellar nuclear somata and the high spontaneous firing rate of Purkinje neurons. This persistence of firing during a constant barrage of inhibition raises the question of what patterns of Purkinje cell input inhibit nuclear cells most effectively. To explore the hypothesis that synaptic depression moderates inhibition at this synapse, we made whole-cell recordings from cerebellar nuclear neurons in mouse brain slices. IPSCs and IPSPs were elicited by electrically stimulating the corticonuclear tract at 10, 50, and 100 Hz. IPSCs evoked at the mean spontaneous firing rate of Purkinje cells (50 Hz) depressed by similar to60%. The onset of depression had a fast, frequency-dependent component, from which recovery was rapid (similar to100 msec), and a slower, frequency-independent component, from which recovery was slow (similar to10 sec). As stimulation rate increased, steady-state depression increased, but each IPSC decayed less completely between stimuli, producing a "tonic" IPSC. Changes in stimulation rate produced rapid changes in the level of depression. Under current clamp, cerebellar nuclear neurons fired spontaneously. During 50 Hz trains of IPSPs, firing was initially interrupted, but resumed coincident with the onset of depression. Low-frequency trains entrained postsynaptic firing, and high-frequency trains greatly slowed firing, primarily because of the tonic IPSC. Thus, the properties of depression at this synapse appear to limit the sensitivity of nuclear cells to basal inhibition, while allowing the cells to respond to increases and decreases in Purkinje cell activity.},

title = {The combined effects of inhibitory and electrical synapses in synchrony},
abstract = {Recent experimental results have shown that GABAergic interneurons in the central nervous system are frequently connected via electrical synapses. Hence, depending on the area or the subpopulation, interneurons interact via inhibitory synapses or electrical synapses alone or via both types of interactions. The theoretical work presented here addresses the significance of these different modes of interactions for the interneuron networks dynamics. We consider the simplest system in which this issue can be investigated in models or in experiments: a pair of neurons, interacting via electrical synapses, inhibitory synapses, or both, and activated by the injection of a noisy external current. Assuming that the couplings and the noise are weak, we derive an analytical expression relating the cross-correlation ( CC) of the activity of the two neurons to the phase response function of the neurons. When electrical and inhibitory interactions are not too strong, they combine their effect in a linear manner. In this regime, the effect of electrical and inhibitory interactions when combined can be deduced knowing the effects of each of the interactions separately. As a consequence, depending on intrinsic neuronal properties, electrical and inhibitory synapses may cooperate, both promoting synchrony, or may compete, with one promoting synchrony while the other impedes it. In contrast, for sufficiently strong couplings, the two types of synapses combine in a nonlinear fashion. Remarkably, we find that in this regime, combining electrical synapses with inhibition amplifies synchrony, whereas electrical synapses alone would desynchronize the activity of the neurons. We apply our theory to predict how the shape of the CC of two neurons changes as a function of ionic channel conductances, focusing on the effect of persistent sodium conductance, of the firing rate of the neurons and the nature and the strength of their interactions. These predictions may be tested using dynamic clamp techniques.},

abstract = {When depressing synapses are embedded in a circuit composed of a pacemaker neuron and a neuron with no autorhythmic properties, the network can show two modes of oscillation. In one mode the synapses are mostly depressed, and the oscillations are dominated by the properties of the oscillating neuron. In the other mode, the synapses recover from depression, and the oscillations are primarily controlled by the synapses. We demonstrate the two modes of oscillation in a hybrid circuit consisting of a biological pacemaker and a model neuron, reciprocally coupled via model depressing synapses. We show that across a wide range of parameter values this network shows robust bistability of the oscillation mode and that it is possible to switch the network from one mode to the other by injection of a brief current pulse in either neuron. The underlying mechanism for bistability may be present in many types of circuits with reciprocal connections and synaptic depression.},

Do dendritic spikes have a salient signaling role under in vivo conditions, where neocortical pyramidal neurons are bombarded with synaptic input? In the present study, levels of synaptic conductance apparent during active network states in vivo were emulated in vitro. Pronounced enhancement of somatic or apical dendritic conductance was spatially compartmentalized and 'visible' over a dendritic length ( approximately 200 microm) on the order of half the voltage length constant, as predicted by passive cable models. The spatial compartmentalization of conductance allowed independent subthreshold synaptic integration at axo-somatic and apical dendritic sites. Furthermore, spikes generated at distal apical dendritic sites efficiently propagated to the axon to initiate action potentials under high synaptic conductance states. The dendritic arborization and voltage-activated channel complement of rat neocortical pyramidal neurons are therefore optimized to allow distributed processing under realistic conductance states.},

abstract = {Networks of oscillators produce vital activity in diverse natural systems. The dynamics of these networks are frequently studied via computational models that assume weak coupling, yet this assumption has not been experimentally validated. We applied weak stimuli to neuronal oscillators in Aplysia californica and deconvolved infinitesimal phase response curves (IPRCs) that describe the phase response of a neuron. We show that these IPRCs reliably predict the phase response for weak stimuli, independent of the stimulus waveform used. These weak stimuli are in the range of normal synaptic activity for these neurons, suggesting that weak coupling is a likely mechanism.},

abstract = {Precisely controlled spike times relative to theta-frequency network oscillations play an important role in hippocampal memory processing. Here we study how inhibitory synaptic input during theta oscillation contributes to the control of spike timing. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells in vitro with dynamic clamp to simulate theta-frequency oscillation (5 Hz), we show that gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A)) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) can not only delay but also advance the postsynaptic spike depending on the timing of the inhibition relative to the oscillation. Spike time advancement with IPSP was abolished by the h-channel blocker ZD7288 (10 microM), suggesting that IPSPs can interact with intrinsic membrane conductances to yield bidirectional control of spike timing.},

abstract = {Sprague-Dawley rats (2-4 months old) were trained to perform a reaching-grasping task while their head was fixated and multielectrode recordings were performed in the ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere. Multiunit (MU) activity was recorded with 2-3 electrodes in the Purkinje cell layer at various depths (1.5-4.5 mm) from the pial surface while the animal either performed the reaching-grasping task or was at rest. Recording sites were visually aligned along the transverse or the sagittal axis of Crus IIa. Excess correlations of MU spike activity were calculated at 10-ms time resolution using the joint peristimulus time histogram (JPSTH), to reveal the dynamics of cross-correlations corrected for nonstationarities in spike rates. Peak correlation amplitudes and areas were calculated separately for a time period preceding the movement and for a succeeding period during which the movement occurred. Correlations were compared across different paradigms: transversal versus sagittal alignment of recordings sites and behavior versus rest. No significant differences were found between transversally and sagittally aligned recording sites. Significant differences in peak correlation amplitude and/or peak area, however, were found both between premovement and movement time, as well as between both these time periods and periods while the animal was at rest.},

title = {Parallel regulation of a modulator-activated current via distinct dynamics underlies comodulation of motor circuit output},
abstract = {The cellular mechanisms underlying comodulation of neuronal networks are not elucidated in most systems. We are addressing this issue by determining the mechanism by which a peptide hormone, crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP), modulates the biphasic (protraction/retraction) gastric mill (chewing) rhythm driven by the projection neuron MCN1 in the crab stomatogastric ganglion. MCN1 activates this rhythm by slow peptidergic (CabTRP Ia) and fast GABAergic excitation of the reciprocally inhibitory central pattern generator neurons LG (protraction) and Int1 (retraction), respectively. MCN1 synaptic transmission is limited to the retraction phase, because LG inhibits MCN1 during protraction. Bath-applied CCAP also excites both LG and Int1, but selectively prolongs protraction. Here, we use computational modeling and dynamic-clamp manipulations to establish that CCAP prolongs the gastric mill protractor (LG) phase and maintains the retractor (Int1) phase duration by activating the same modulator-activated inward current (I(MI)) in LG as MCN1-released CabTRP Ia. However, the CCAP-activated current (I(MI-CCAP)) and MCN1-activated current (I(MI-MCN1)) exhibit distinct time courses in LG during protraction. This distinction results from I(MI-CCAP) being regulated only by postsynaptic voltage, whereas I(MI-MCN1) is also regulated by LG presynaptic inhibition of MCN1. Hence, without CCAP, retraction and protraction duration are determined by the time course of I(MI-MCN1) buildup and feedback inhibition-mediated decay, respectively, in LG. With I(MI-CCAP) continually present, the impact of the feedback inhibition is reduced, prolonging protraction and maintaining retraction duration. Thus, comodulation of rhythmic motor activity can result from convergent activation, via distinct dynamics, of a single voltage-dependent current.},

title = {Models of respiratory rhythm generation in the pre-B{\"o}tzinger complex. II. Populations Of coupled pacemaker neurons},
abstract = {We have proposed models for the ionic basis of oscillatory bursting of respiratory pacemaker neurons in the pre-B{\"o}tzinger complex. In this paper, we investigate the frequency control and synchronization of these model neurons when coupled by excitatory amino-acid-mediated synapses and controlled by convergent synaptic inputs modeled as tonic excitation. Simulations of pairs of identical cells reveal that increasing tonic excitation increases the frequency of synchronous bursting, while increasing the strength of excitatory coupling between the neurons decreases the frequency of synchronous bursting. Low levels of coupling extend the range of values of tonic excitation where synchronous bursting is found. Simulations of a heterogeneous population of 50-500 bursting neurons reveal coupling effects similar to those found experimentally in vitro: coupling increases the mean burst duration and decreases the mean burst frequency. Burst synchronization occurred over a wide range of intrinsic frequencies (0.1-1 Hz) and even in populations where as few as 10% of the cells were intrinsically bursting. Weak coupling, extreme parameter heterogeneity, and low levels of depolarizing input could contribute to the desynchronization of the population and give rise to quasiperiodic states. The introduction of sparse coupling did not affect the burst synchrony, although it did make the interburst intervals more irregular from cycle to cycle. At a population level, both parameter heterogeneity and excitatory coupling synergistically combine to increase the dynamic input range: robust synchronous bursting persisted across a much greater range of parameter space (in terms of mean depolarizing input) than that of a single model cell. This extended dynamic range for the bursting cell population indicates that cellular heterogeneity is functionally advantageous. Our modeled system accounts for the range of intrinsic frequencies and spiking patterns of inspiratory (I) bursting cells found in the pre-B{\"o}tzinger complex in neonatal rat brain stem slices in vitro. There is a temporal dispersion in the spiking onset times of neurons in the population, predicted to be due to heterogeneity in intrinsic neuronal properties, with neurons starting to spike before (pre-I), with (I), or after (late-I) the onset of the population burst. Experimental tests for a number of the model's predictions are proposed.},

abstract = {Activation of D2 autoreceptors on midbrain dopamine neurons has been shown previously to acutely open K+ channels to inhibit intrinsically generated pacemaker activity. Here we report that D2 autoreceptors act chronically to produce an opposite action: to increase the speed and regularity of repetitive action potential firing. Voltage-, current-, and dynamic-clamp experiments, using conventional whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp recording, with cultured rat midbrain dopamine neurons show that a change in the number of functional A-type K+ channels alters firing rate and susceptibility to irregularity produced by other channels. cAMP and protein kinase A mediate the long-term action of D2 receptors in a manner that counters the short-term effect of this signaling pathway on K+ channel gating. We conclude that D2 autoreceptors, in addition to mediating acute negative feedback, are responsible for long-term enhancement of the rate and fidelity of dopamine neuron pacemaker activity.},

abstract = {Deep cerebellar nuclear (DCN) neurons exhibit distinct phenotypes of rebound discharge following current-evoked membrane hyperpolarizations that arise from specific Ca(V)3 T-type Ca(2+) channel isoforms and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels. The probability of evoking rebound bursts following a brief train of GABAergic inhibitory synaptic input from cerebellar Purkinje cells was recently questioned for stimulus intensities adjusted to evoke a long post-stimulus pause in spike firing. We revisited this issue to examine the potential for generating rebound bursts in DCN cells in response to synaptic inputs in vitro. Both a Transient and Weak Burst phenotype could be distinguished in on-cell extracellular recordings or whole-cell recordings in response to inhibitory synaptic input. We found that the rebound burst response was a sensitive function of stimulus intensity, such that increasing stimulus intensity significantly raised the probability for evoking bursts while decreasing pause duration. The threshold for reliably generating rebound bursts was approximately 40 percent of maximum intensity, a level that evokes an IPSC corresponding to only a small number of the inhibitory terminals known to impinge on DCN cells. The probability for evoking rebound bursts is thus very high for moderate levels of stimulation in vitro, leaving the potential for rebound discharge to contribute to signal processing in vivo an open question.},

title = {Orientation tuning of input conductance, excitation, and inhibition in cat primary visual cortex},
abstract = {The input conductance of cells in the cat primary visual cortex (V1) has been shown recently to grow substantially during visual stimulation. Because increasing conductance can have a divisive effect on the synaptic input, theoretical proposals have ascribed to it specific functions. According to the veto model, conductance increases would serve to sharpen orientation tuning by increasing most at off-optimal orientations. According to the normalization model, conductance increases would control the cell's gain, by being independent of stimulus orientation and by growing with stimulus contrast. We set out to test these proposals and to determine the visual properties and possible synaptic origin of the conductance increases. We recorded the membrane potential of cat V1 cells while injecting steady currents and presenting drifting grating patterns of varying contrast and orientation. Input conductance grew with stimulus contrast by 20-300%, generally more in simple cells (40-300%) than in complex cells (20-120%), and in simple cells was strongly modulated in time. Conductance was invariably maximal for stimuli of the preferred orientation. Thus conductance changes contribute to a gain control mechanism, but the strength of this gain control does not depend uniquely on contrast. By assuming that the conductance changes are entirely synaptic, we further derived the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances underlying the visual responses. In simple cells, these conductances were often arranged in push-pull: excitation increased when inhibition decreased and vice versa. Excitation and inhibition had similar preferred orientations and did not appear to differ in tuning width, suggesting that the intracortical synaptic inputs to simple cells of cat V1 originate from cells with similar orientation tuning. This finding is at odds with models where orientation tuning in simple cells is achieved by inhibition at off-optimal orientations or sharpened by inhibition that is more broadly tuned than excitation.},

title = {Inhibition of interneuron firing extends the spread of endocannabinoid signaling in the cerebellum},
abstract = {Endocannabinoids serve as retrograde messengers in many brain regions. These diffusible lipophilic molecules are released by postsynaptic cells and regulate presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Here we describe an additional mechanism that mediates the spread of endocannabinoid signaling to distant inhibitory synapses. Depolarization of cerebellar Purkinje cells reduced the firing rate of nearby interneurons, and this reduction in firing was blocked by the cannabinoid receptor antagonist AM251. The cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 also reduced firing rates in interneurons, and this inhibition arose from the activation of a small potassium conductance. Thus, endocannabinoids released from the dendrites of depolarized neurons can lead to inhibition of firing in nearby cells. Because interneurons can project over several hundred micrometers, this inhibition of firing allows cells to regulate synaptic inputs at distances well beyond the limits of endocannabinoid diffusion.},

title = {Fast Kalman filtering on quasilinear dendritic trees},
abstract = {Optimal filtering of noisy voltage signals on dendritic trees is a key problem in computational cellular neuroscience. However, the state variable in this problem-the vector of voltages at every compartment-is very high-dimensional: realistic multicompartmental models often have on the order of N = 10(4) compartments. Standard implementations of the Kalman filter require O(N (3)) time and O(N (2)) space, and are therefore impractical. Here we take advantage of three special features of the dendritic filtering problem to construct an efficient filter: (1) dendritic dynamics are governed by a cable equation on a tree, which may be solved using sparse matrix methods in O(N) time; and current methods for observing dendritic voltage (2) provide low SNR observations and (3) only image a relatively small number of compartments at a time. The idea is to approximate the Kalman equations in terms of a low-rank perturbation of the steady-state (zero-SNR) solution, which may be obtained in O(N) time using methods that exploit the sparse tree structure of dendritic dynamics. The resulting methods give a very good approximation to the exact Kalman solution, but only require O(N) time and space. We illustrate the method with applications to real and simulated dendritic branching structures, and describe how to extend the techniques to incorporate spatially subsampled, temporally filtered, and nonlinearly transformed observations.},

title = {Constraining compartmental models using multiple voltage recordings and genetic algorithms},
abstract = {Compartmental models with many nonlinearly and nonhomogeneous distributions of voltage-gated conductances are routinely used to investigate the physiology of complex neurons. However, the number of loosely constrained parameters makes manually constructing the desired model a daunting if not impossible task. Recently, progress has been made using automated parameter search methods, such as genetic algorithms (GAs). However, these methods have been applied to somatically recorded action potentials using relatively simple target functions. Using a genetic minimization algorithm and a reduced compartmental model based on a previously published model of layer 5 neocortical pyramidal neurons we compared the efficacy of five cost functions (based on the waveform of the membrane potential, the interspike interval, trajectory density, and their combinations) to constrain the model. When the model was constrained using somatic recordings only, a combined cost function was found to be the most effective. This combined cost function was then applied to investigate the contribution of dendritic and axonal recordings to the ability of the GA to constrain the model. The more recording locations from the dendrite and the axon that were added to the data set the better was the genetic minimization algorithm able to constrain the compartmental model. Based on these simulations we propose an experimental scheme that, in combination with a genetic minimization algorithm, may be used to constrain compartmental models of neurons.},

title = {Synaptic control of spiking in cerebellar Purkinje cells: Dynamic current clamp based on model conductances},
abstract = {Previous simulations using a realistic model of a cerebellar Purkinje cell suggested that synaptic control of somatic spiking in this cell type is mediated by voltage-gated intrinsic conductances and that inhibitory rather than excitatory synaptic inputs are more influential in controlling spike timing. In this paper, we have tested these predictions physiologically using dynamic current clamping to apply model-derived synaptic conductances to Purkinje cells in vitro. As predicted by the model, this input transformed the in vitro pattern of spiking into a different spike pattern typically observed in vivo. A net inhibitory synaptic current was required to achieve such spiking, indicating the presence of strong intrinsic depolarizing currents. Spike-triggered averaging confirmed that the length of individual intervals between spikes was correlated to the amplitude of the inhibitory conductance but was not influenced by excitatory inputs. Through repeated presentation of identical stimuli, we determined that the output spike rate was very sensitive to the relative balance of excitation and inhibition in the input conductances. In contrast, the accuracy of spike timing was dependent on input amplitude and was independent of spike rate. Thus, information could be encoded in Purkinje cell spiking in a precise spike time code and a rate code at the same time. We conclude that Purkinje cell responses to synaptic input are strongly dependent on active somatic and dendritic properties and that theories of cerebellar function likely need to incorporate single-cell dynamics to a greater degree than is customary.},

Rates of simple spike firing in both on-beam and off-beam Purkinje cell pairs commonly showed great variety in depth of modulation during reaching behavior. But with respect to timing, on-beam Purkinje cell pairs had simple spikes that were tightly time-locked to each other (either delayed or simultaneous) and to movement, despite the variability in rate. By contrast, off-beam Purkinje cell pairs had simple spikes that were not time-locked to each other, neither delayed nor simultaneous.

title = {Possible effects of depolarizing GABA(A) conductance on the neuronal input-output relationship: a modeling study},
abstract = {Recent in vitro experiments revealed that the GABA(A) reversal potential is about 10 mV higher than the resting potential in mature mammalian neocortical pyramidal cells; thus GABAergic inputs could have facilitatory, rather than inhibitory, effects on action potential generation under certain conditions. However, how the relationship between excitatory input conductances and the output firing rate is modulated by such depolarizing GABAergic inputs under in vivo circumstances has not yet been understood. We examine herewith the input - output relationship in a simple conductance-based model of cortical neurons with the depolarized GABA(A) reversal potential, and show that a tonic depolarizing GABAergic conductance up to a certain amount does not change the relationship between a tonic glutamatergic driving conductance and the output firing rate, whereas a higher GABAergic conductance prevents spike generation. When the tonic glutamatergic and GABAergic conductances are replaced by in vivo - like highly fluctuating inputs, on the other hand, the effect of depolarizing GABAergic inputs on the input - output relationship critically depends on the degree of coincidence between glutamatergic input events and GABAergic ones. Although a wide range of depolarizing GABAergic inputs hardly changes the firing rate of a neuron driven by noncoincident glutamatergic inputs, a certain range of these inputs considerably decreases the firing rate if a large number of driving glutamatergic inputs are coincident with them. These results raise the possibility that the depolarized GABA A reversal potential is not a paradoxical mystery, but is instead a sophisticated device for discriminative firing rate modulation.},

title = {Bursting in leech heart interneurons: cell-autonomous and network-based mechanisms},
abstract = {Rhythmic activity within the heartbeat pattern generator of the medicinal leech is based on the alternating bursting of mutually inhibitory pairs of oscillator heart interneurons (half-center oscillators). Bicuculline methiodide has been shown to block mutual inhibition between these interneurons and to cause them to spike tonically while recorded intracellularly (Schmidt and Calabrese, 1992). Using extracellular recording techniques, we show here that oscillator and premotor heart interneurons continue to burst when pharmacologically isolated with bicuculline, although the bursting is not robust in some preparations. We propose that a nonspecific leak current introduced by the intracellular microelectrode suppresses endogenous bursting activity to account for the discrepancy with results using intracellular recording. A two-parameter bifurcation diagram (E(leak) vs g(leak)) of a mathematical model of a single heart interneuron shows a narrow stripe of parameter values where bursting occurs, separating large zones of tonic spiking and silence. A similar analysis performed for a half-center oscillator model outlined a much larger area of bursting. Bursting in the half-center oscillator model is also less sensitive to variation in the maximal conductances of voltage-gated currents than in the single-neuron model. Thus, in addition to ensuring appropriate bursting characteristics such as period, phase, and duty cycles, the half-center configuration enhances oscillation robustness, making them less susceptible to random or imposed changes in membrane parameters. Endogenous bursting, in turn, ensures appropriate bursting if the strength of mutual inhibition is weakened and limits the minimum period of the half-center oscillator to a period near that of the single neuron.},

abstract = {Dopaminergic neurons of the ventral midbrain fire high-frequency bursts when animals are presented with unexpected rewards, or stimuli that predict reward. To identify the afferents that can initiate bursting and establish therapeutic strategies for diseases affected by altered bursting, a mechanistic understanding of bursting is essential. Our results show that bursting is initiated by a specific interaction between the voltage sensitivity of NMDA receptors and voltage-gated ion channels that results in the activation of an intrinsic, action potential-independent, high-frequency membrane potential oscillation. We further show that the NMDA receptor is uniquely suited for this because of the rapid kinetics and voltage dependence imparted to it by Mg(2+) ion block and unblock. This mechanism explains the discrete nature of bursting in dopaminergic cells and demonstrates how synaptic signals may be reshaped by local intrinsic properties of a neuron before influencing action potential generation.},

title = {A low-cost multielectrode system for data acquisition enabling real-time closed-loop processing with rapid recovery from stimulation artifacts},
abstract = {Commercially available data acquisition systems for multielectrode recording from freely moving animals are expensive, often rely on proprietary software, and do not provide detailed, modifiable circuit schematics. When used in conjunction with electrical stimulation, they are prone to prolonged, saturating stimulation artifacts that prevent the recording of short-latency evoked responses. Yet electrical stimulation is integral to many experimental designs, and critical for emerging brain-computer interfacing and neuroprosthetic applications. To address these issues, we developed an easy-to-use, modifiable, and inexpensive system for multielectrode neural recording and stimulation. Setup costs are less than US{\$}10,000 for 64 channels, an order of magnitude lower than comparable commercial systems. Unlike commercial equipment, the system recovers rapidly from stimulation and allows short-latency action potentials (<1 ms post-stimulus) to be detected, facilitating closed-loop applications and exposing neural activity that would otherwise remain hidden. To illustrate this capability, evoked activity from microstimulation of the rodent hippocampus is presented. System noise levels are similar to existing platforms, and extracellular action potentials and local field potentials can be recorded simultaneously. The system is modular, in banks of 16 channels, and flexible in usage: while primarily designed for in vivo use, it can be combined with commercial preamplifiers to record from in vitro multielectrode arrays. The system's open-source control software, NeuroRighter, is implemented in C{\#}, with an easy-to-use graphical interface. As C{\#} functions in a managed code environment, which may impact performance, analysis was conducted to ensure comparable speed to C++ for this application. Hardware schematics, layout files, and software are freely available. Since maintaining wired headstage connections with freely moving animals is difficult, we describe a new method of electrode-headstage coupling using neodymium magnets.},

title = {The interaction of intrinsic dynamics and network topology in determining network burst synchrony},
abstract = {The pre-B{\"o}tzinger complex (pre-B{\"o}tC), within the mammalian respiratory brainstem, represents an ideal system for investigating the synchronization properties of complex neuronal circuits via the interaction of cell-type heterogeneity and network connectivity. In isolation, individual respiratory neurons from the pre-B{\"o}tC may be tonically active, rhythmically bursting, or quiescent. Despite this intrinsic heterogeneity, coupled networks of pre-B{\"o}tC neurons en bloc engage in synchronized bursting that can drive inspiratory motor neuron activation. The region's connection topology has been recently characterized and features dense clusters of cells with occasional connections between clusters. We investigate how the dynamics of individual neurons (quiescent/bursting/tonic) and the betweenness centrality of neurons' positions within the network connectivity graph interact to govern network burst synchrony, by simulating heterogeneous networks of computational model pre-B{\"o}tC neurons. Furthermore, we compare the prevalence and synchrony of bursting across networks constructed with a variety of connection topologies, analyzing the same collection of heterogeneous neurons in small-world, scale-free, random, and regularly structured networks. We find that several measures of network burst synchronization are determined by interactions of network topology with the intrinsic dynamics of neurons at central network positions and by the strengths of synaptic connections between neurons. Surprisingly, despite the functional role of synchronized bursting within the pre-B{\"o}tC, we find that synchronized network bursting is generally weakest when we use its specific connection topology, which leads to synchrony within clusters but poor coordination across clusters. Overall, our results highlight the relevance of interactions between topology and intrinsic dynamics in shaping the activity of networks and the concerted effects of connectivity patterns and dynamic heterogeneities.},

abstract = {The Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a right ventricular (RV) arrhythmia that is responsible for up to 12% of sudden cardiac deaths. The aims of our study were to determine the cellular mechanisms of the electrical abnormality in BrS and the potential basis of the RV contractile abnormality observed in the syndrome. Tetrodotoxin was used to reduce cardiac Na(+) current (I(Na)) to mimic a BrS-like setting in canine ventricular myocytes. Moderate reduction (<50%) of INa with TTX resulted in all-or-none repolarization in a fraction of RV epicardial myocytes. Dynamic clamp and modeling show that reduction of INa shifts the AP duration-transient outward current (I(to)) density curve to the left, and has a bi-phasic effect on action potential (AP) duration; in the presence of a large Ito, I(Na) reduction either prolongs or collapses the AP, depending on the exact density of Ito. These repolarization changes reduce Ca(2+) influx and sarcoplasmic reticulum load, resulting in marked attenuation of myocyte contraction and Ca(2+) transient in RV epicardial myocytes. We conclude that I(Na) reduction alters repolarization by reducing the threshold for I(to)-induced all-or-none repolarization. These cellular electrical changes suppress myocyte excitation-contraction coupling and contraction, and may be a contributing factor to the contractile abnormality of the RV wall in BrS.},

It is commonly used to simulate computational ionic currents in real-time and inject the resulting current into the neuron, as if it were part of the cell. Increasing the magnitude of the simulated conductances leads to transient instabilities. In this paper we use physical experiments, computational simulation, and stability analysis to examine the effects uncompensated electrode resistance and sampling delay have on this transient instability. We find that uncompensated electrode resistance decreases the maximum usable conductance that maintains a stable system. Also, we find that commonly used sampling rates limit the maximum conductance that maintains a stable system, and that these limitations are not due to the kinetics of the underlying ion channel model.},

title = {Electrical synapses and synchrony: the role of intrinsic currents},
abstract = {Electrical synapses are ubiquitous in the mammalian CNS. Particularly in the neocortex, electrical synapses have been shown to connect low-threshold spiking (LTS) as well as fast spiking (FS) interneurons. Experiments have highlighted the roles of electrical synapses in the dynamics of neuronal networks. Here we investigate theoretically how intrinsic cell properties affect the synchronization of neurons interacting by electrical synapses. Numerical simulations of a network of conductance-based neurons randomly connected with electrical synapses show that potassium currents promote synchrony, whereas the persistent sodium current impedes it. Furthermore, synchrony varies with the firing rate in qualitatively different ways depending on the intrinsic currents. We also study analytically a network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons. We relate the stability of the asynchronous state of this network to the phase-response function (PRF), which characterizes the effect of small perturbations on the firing timing of the neurons. In particular, we show that the greater the skew of the PRF toward the first half of the period, the more stable the asynchronous state. Combining our simulations with our analytical results, we establish general rules to predict the dynamic state of large networks of neurons coupled with electrical synapses. Our work provides a natural explanation for surprising experimental observations that blocking electrical synapses may increase the synchrony of neuronal activity. It also suggests different synchronization properties for LTS and FS cells. Finally, we propose to further test our predictions in experiments using dynamic clamp techniques.},

title = {Kv3 potassium conductance is necessary and kinetically optimized for high-frequency action potential generation in hippocampal interneurons},
abstract = {Kv3 channels are thought to be essential for the fast-spiking (FS) phenotype in GABAergic interneurons, but how these channels confer the ability to generate action potentials (APs) at high frequency is unknown. To address this question, we developed a fast dynamic-clamp system (approximately 50 kHz) that allowed us to add a Kv3 model conductance to CA1 oriens alveus (OA) interneurons in hippocampal slices. Selective pharmacological block of Kv3 channels by 0.3 mm 4-aminopyridine or 1 mm tetraethylammonium ions led to a marked broadening of APs during trains of short stimuli and a reduction in AP frequency during 1 sec stimuli. The addition of artificial Kv3 conductance restored the original AP pattern. Subtraction of Kv3 conductance by dynamic clamp mimicked the effects of the blockers. Application of artificial Kv3 conductance also led to FS in OA interneurons after complete K+ channel block and even induced FS in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in the absence of blockers. Adding artificial Kv3 conductance with altered deactivation kinetics revealed a nonmonotonic relationship between mean AP frequency and deactivation rate, with a maximum slightly above the original value. Insertion of artificial Kv3 conductance with either lowered activation threshold or inactivation also led to a reduction in the mean AP frequency. However, the mechanisms were distinct. Shifting the activation threshold induced adaptation, whereas adding inactivation caused frequency-dependent AP broadening. In conclusion, Kv3 channels are necessary for the FS phenotype of OA interneurons, and several of their gating properties appear to be optimized for high-frequency repetitive activity.},

abstract = {Neurons in sensory systems respond to stimuli within their receptive fields, but the magnitude of the response depends on specific stimulus features. In the rodent whisker system, the response magnitude to the deflection of a particular whisker is, in most cells, dependent on the direction of deflection. Here we use in vivo intracellular recordings from thalamorecipient neurons in layers 3 and 4 of the rat barrel cortex to elucidate the dynamics of the synaptic inputs underlying direction selectivity. We show that cells are direction selective despite a broadly tuned excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input. Selectivity emerges from a direction-dependent temporal shift of excitation relative to inhibition. For preferred direction deflections, excitation precedes inhibition, but as the direction diverges from the preferred, this separation decreases. Our results illustrate a mechanism by which the timing of the synaptic inputs, and not their relative peak amplitudes, primarily determine feature selectivity.},

title = {Contributions of the input signal and prior activation history to the discharge behaviour of rat motoneurones},
abstract = {The principal computational operation of neurones is the transformation of synaptic inputs into spike train outputs. The probability of spike occurrence in neurones is determined by the time course and magnitude of the total current reaching the spike initiation zone. The features of this current that are most effective in evoking spikes can be determined by injecting a Gaussian current waveform into a neurone and using spike-triggered reverse correlation to calculate the average current trajectory (ACT) preceding spikes. The time course of this ACT (and the related first-order Wiener kernel) provides a general description of a neurone's response to dynamic stimuli. In many different neurones, the ACT is characterized by a shallow hyperpolarizing trough followed by a more rapid depolarizing peak immediately preceding the spike. The hyperpolarizing phase is thought to reflect an enhancement of excitability by partial removal of sodium inactivation. Alternatively, this feature could simply reflect the fact that interspike intervals that are longer than average can only occur when the current is lower than average toward the end of the interspike interval. Thus, the ACT calculated for the entire spike train displays an attenuated version of the hyperpolarizing trough associated with the long interspike intervals. This alternative explanation for the characteristic shape of the ACT implies that it depends upon the time since the previous spike, i.e. the ACT reflects both previous stimulus history and previous discharge history. The present study presents results based on recordings of noise-driven discharge in rat hypoglossal motoneurones that support this alternative explanation. First, we show that the hyperpolarizing trough is larger in ACTs calculated from spikes preceded by long interspike intervals, and minimal or absent in those based on short interspike intervals. Second, we show that the trough is present for ACTs calculated from the discharge of a threshold-crossing neurone model with a postspike afterhyperpolarization (AHP), but absent from those calculated from the discharge of a model without an AHP. We show that it is possible to represent noise-driven discharge using a two-component linear model that predicts discharge probability based on the sum of a feedback kernel and a stimulus kernel. The feedback kernel reflects the influence of prior discharge mediated by the AHP, and it increases in amplitude when AHP amplitude is increased by pharmacological manipulations. Finally, we show that the predictions of this model are virtually identical to those based on the first-order Wiener kernel. This suggests that the Wiener kernels derived from standard white-noise analysis of noise-driven discharge in neurones actually reflect the effects of both stimulus and discharge history.},

Although studies on brain slices have led to detailed knowledge of how nondriving input affects dendritic integration, its origin and functional implications remain unclear. We tackle this issue using an ensemble of fly wide-field visual interneurons. These neurons offer the opportunity not only to combine in vivo recording techniques and natural sensory stimulation but also to interpret electrophysiological results in a behavioral context. By targeted manipulation of the animal's visual input we find a pronounced modulating impact of nondriving input, whereas functionally important cellular properties like direction tuning and the coding of pattern velocity are left almost unaffected. We propose that the integration of functionally different synaptic inputs is a mechanism that immanently equalizes the ensemble's sensitivity irrespective of the specific stimulus conditions.},

Experimental access to this threshold dynamics is required in order to fully characterize neuronal input-output relationships. The challenge is practically intractable using present day experimental paradigms due to the cumulative, non-linear interactions involved. Here we introduce the Neuronal Response Clamp, a closed-loop technique enabling control over the instantaneous response probability of the neuron. The potential of the technique is demonstrated by showing direct access to threshold dynamics of cortical neuron in vitro using extracellular recording and stimulation, over timescales ranging from seconds to many hours. Moreover, the method allowed us to expose the sensitivity of threshold dynamics to spontaneous input from the network in which the neuron is embedded. The Response-Clamp technique follows the rationale of the voltage-clamp and dynamic-clamp approaches, extending it to the neuron's spiking behavior. The general framework offered here is applicable in the study of other neural systems, beyond the single neuron level.},

abstract = {Six neuromodulators [proctolin, Cancer borealis tachykinin-related peptide Ia, crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP), red pigment-concentrating hormone, TNRNFLRFamide, and pilocarpine] converge onto the same voltage-dependent inward current in stomatogastric ganglion (STG) neurons of the crab C. borealis. We show here that each of these modulators acts on a distinct subset of pyloric network neurons in the STG. To ask whether the differences in cell targets could account for their differential effects on the pyloric rhythm, we systematically compared the motor patterns produced by proctolin and CCAP. The motor patterns produced in proctolin and CCAP differed quantitatively in a number of ways. Proctolin and CCAP both act on the lateral pyloric neuron and the inferior cardiac neuron. Proctolin additionally acts on the pyloric dilator (PD) neurons, the pyloric (PY) neurons, and the ventricular dilator neuron. Using the dynamic clamp, we introduced an artificial peptide-elicited current into the PD and PY neurons, in the presence of CCAP, and converted the CCAP rhythm into a rhythm that was statistically similar to that seen in proctolin. This suggests that the differences in the network effects of these two modulators can primarily be attributed to the known differential distributions of their receptors onto distinct subsets of neurons, despite the fact that they activate the same current.},

title = {Network variability limits stimulus-evoked spike timing precision in retinal ganglion cells},
abstract = {Visual, auditory, somatosensory, and olfactory stimuli generate temporally precise patterns of action potentials (spikes). It is unclear, however, how the precision of spike generation relates to the pattern and variability of synaptic input elicited by physiological stimuli. We determined how synaptic conductances evoked by light stimuli that activate the rod bipolar pathway control spike generation in three identified types of mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The relative amplitude, timing, and impact of excitatory and inhibitory input differed dramatically between On and Off RGCs. Spikes evoked by repeated somatic injection of identical light-evoked synaptic conductances were more temporally precise than those evoked by light. However, the precision of spikes evoked by conductances that varied from trial to trial was similar to that of light-evoked spikes. Thus, the rod bipolar pathway modulates different RGCs via unique combinations of synaptic input, and RGC temporal variability reflects variability in the input this circuit provides.},

title = {Genetic algorithm for optimization and specification of a neuron model},
abstract = {We present a novel approach for neuron model specification using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to develop simple firing neuron models consisting of a single compartment with one inward and one outward current. The GA not only chooses the model parameters, but also chooses the formulation of the ionic currents (i.e. single-variable, two-variable, instantaneous, or leak). The fitness function of the GA compares the frequency output of the GA generated models to an I-F curve of a nominal Morris-Lecar (ML) model. Initially, several different classes of models compete among the population. Eventually, the GA converges to a population containing only ML-type firing models with an instantaneous inward and single-variable outward current. Simulations where ML-type models are restricted from the population are also investigated. This GA approach allows the exploration of a universe of feasible model classes that is less constrained by model formulation assumptions than traditional parameter estimation approaches. While we use a simple model, this technique is scalable to much larger and more complex formulations.},

abstract = {The reversal potential of GABA(A) receptor channels is known to be less negative than the resting membrane potential under some cases. Recent electrophysiological experiments revealed that a GABAergic unitary conductance with such a depolarized reversal potential could not only prevent but also facilitate action potential generation depending on the timing of its application relative to the excitatory unitary conductance. Using a two-dimensional point neuron model, we simulate the experiments regarding the integration of unitary conductances, and execute bifurcation analysis. Then we extend our analysis to the case in which the neuron receives two kinds of periodic input trains-an excitatory one and a GABAergic one. We show that the periodic depolarizing GABAergic input train can modulate the output time-averaged. ring rate bidirectionally, namely as an increase or a decrease, in a devil's-staircase-like manner depending on the phase difference with the excitatory input train. Bifurcation analysis reveals the existence of a wide variety of phase-locked solutions underlying such a graded response of the neuron. We examine how the input time-width and the value of the GABAA reversal potential affect the response. Moreover, considering a neuronal population, we show that depolarizing GABAergic inputs bidirectionally modulate the amplitude of the oscillatory population activity.},

title = {Effect of neuritic cables on conductance estimates for remote electrical synapses},
abstract = {The conductance of electrical synapses is usually estimated from voltage recordings at the neuronal somata under the assumption that each cell is isopotential. This approach neglects effects of intervening neurites. For a cell pair with unbranched neurites and an electrical synapse at their ends, we used cable theory to derive an analytical expression that relates the synaptic conductance to voltage recordings at the cell bodies and to the neurite properties. The equation implies that the conventional method significantly underestimates the actual synapse conductance if the neurite length is comparable to the electrotonic length constant and if the synaptic conductance is similar to the serial neurite conductance. For an experimental test, we cultured pairs of snail neurons on protein patterns, resulting in a geometry that matched the theoretical model. Using the isopotential theory, we estimated the synapse conductances and found them to be rather weak. To obtain the cable properties, we recorded spatiotemporal maps of signal propagation in the neurites using a voltage-sensitive dye. Fits of these maps to a passive cable model showed that the snail neurons are electrotonically rather compact. Given these features of our experimental system, the synaptic conductances derived with the nonisopotential model deviated from the estimates of the isopotential theory by about 13%. This discrepancy, although small, shows that even in electrotonically compact neurons coupled by weak synapses the impact of the neuritic cables on conductance estimates cannot be neglected. When applied to less compact and more strongly coupled cell pairs in vivo, our approach can supply the realistic estimates of synaptic conductances that are necessary for a better understanding of the role of electrical coupling in neural systems.},

We present a generalized, scalable field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based architecture for fast computation of neural models and focus on the steps involved in implementing a single-compartment and a two-compartment neuron model. Based on timing tests, it is shown that FPGAs can outperform traditional desktop computers insimulatin- these fairly simple models and would most likely provide even larger performance gains over Computers in simulating more complex models. The potential of this method for improving neural modeling and dynamic clamping is discussed. In particular, it is believed that this approach could greatly speed up simulations of both highly complex single neuron models and networks of neurons. Additionally, our design is particularly well suited to automated parameter searches for tuning model behavior and to real-time simulation.},

title = {Pyramidal neuron conductance state gates spike-timing-dependent plasticity},
abstract = {Neocortical neurons in vivo process each of their individual inputs in the context of ongoing synaptic background activity, produced by the thousands of presynaptic partners a typical neuron has. Previous work has shown that background activity affects multiple aspects of neuronal and network function. However, its effect on the induction of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is not clear. Here we report that injections of simulated background conductances (produced by a dynamic-clamp system) into pyramidal cells in rat brain slices selectively reduced the magnitude of timing-dependent synaptic potentiation while leaving the magnitude of timing-dependent synaptic depression unchanged. The conductance-dependent suppression also sharpened the STDP curve, with reliable synaptic potentiation induced only when EPSPs and action potentials (APs) were paired within 8 ms of each other. Dual somatic and dendritic patch recordings suggested that the deficit in synaptic potentiation arose from shunting of dendritic EPSPs and APs. Using a biophysically detailed computational model, we were not only able to replicate the conductance-dependent shunting of dendritic potentials, but show that synaptic background can truncate calcium dynamics within dendritic spines in a way that affects potentiation more strongly than depression. This conductance-dependent regulation of synaptic plasticity may constitute a novel homeostatic mechanism that can prevent the runaway synaptic potentiation to which Hebbian networks are vulnerable.},

Recent in vitro brain slice studies have characterized synaptic plasticity in the two main feedback pathways to the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL), a primary electrosensory nucleus in Apteronotus leptorhynchus. Currently-used slice preparations, involving networks in open-loop conditions, allow feedback inputs to be studied in isolation, a critical step in determining their synaptic properties. However, to fully understand electrosensory processing, we must understand how dynamic feedback modulates neuronal responses under closed-loop conditions. To bridge the gap between current in vitro approaches and more complex in vivo work, we present two new in vitro approaches for studying the roles of closed-loop feedback in electrosensory processing. The first involves a hybrid-network approach using dynamic clamp, and the second involves a new slice preparation that preserves one of the feedback pathways to ELL in a closed-loop condition.},

title = {Stages of spike time variability during neuronal responses to transient inputs},
abstract = {In cerebral cortex, cells tend to fire in response to strong transient fluctuations in input, produced by synchronous population activity, which reset the precision of firing and erase correlations between prior and future spike times. Here, using experiments and modeling, we study the accumulation of spike time variance in response to single decaying transient stimuli. All such responses go through distinct stages in time. When the stimulus is high, variance is held low, while at low stimulus levels near threshold, variance rises dramatically, approaching a Poisson level. This behavior was reproduced in a stochastically simulated Hodgkin-Huxley model, and in two simpler models, class 1 (Morris-Lecar) and class 2 (FitzHugh-Nagumo), incorporating Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise. Early stage variance represents perturbation of uniform limit-cycle motion of the dynamical variables. Late stage variance reflects random motion of the dynamical variables captured within the basin of the resting fixed point. We show that the two stages have different sensitivities to the amplitude and time scale of noise, and relate this to coherence resonance. This rapid breakdown in reliability during responses to transient stimuli may restrict precise signalling by spike times to brief time windows, and limit the duration of coherent synchronous responses in the cortex.},

abstract = {We have used a realistic computer model to examine interactions between synaptic and intrinsic voltage-gated currents during somatic spiking in cerebellar Purkinje cells. We have shown previously that this model generates realistic in vivo patterns of somatic spiking in the presence of continuous background excitatory and inhibitory input (De Schutter and Bower, 1994b). In the present study, we analyzed the flow of synaptic and intrinsic currents across the dendritic membrane and the interaction between the soma and dendrite underlying this spiking behavior. This analysis revealed that: (1) dendritic inward current flow was dominated by a noninactivating P-type calcium current, resulting in a continuous level of depolarization; (2) the mean level of this depolarization was controlled by the mean rate of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input; (3) the synaptic control involved a voltage-clamping mechanism exerted by changes of synaptic driving force at different membrane potentials; (4) the resulting total current through excitatory and inhibitory synapses was near-zero, with a small outward bias opposing the P-type calcium current; (5) overall, the dendrite acted as a variable current sink with respect to the soma, slowing down intrinsic inward currents in the soma; (6) the somato-dendritic current showed important phasic changes during each spike cycle; and (7) the precise timing of somatic spikes was the result of complex interactions between somatic and dendritic currents that did not directly reflect the timing of synaptic input. These modeling results suggest that Purkinje cells act quite differently from simple summation devices, as has been assumed previously in most models of cerebellar function. Specific physiologically testable predictions are discussed.},

title = {Pacemaker neuron and network oscillations depend on a neuromodulator-regulated linear current},
abstract = {Linear leak currents have been implicated in the regulation of neuronal excitability, generation of neuronal and network oscillations, and network state transitions. Yet, few studies have directly tested the dependence of network oscillations on leak currents or explored the role of leak currents on network activity. In the oscillatory pyloric network of decapod crustaceans neuromodulatory inputs are necessary for pacemaker activity. A large subset of neuromodulators is known to activate a single voltage-gated inward current I(MI), which has been shown to regulate the rhythmic activity of the network and its pacemaker neurons. Using the dynamic clamp technique, we show that the crucial component of I(MI) for the generation of oscillatory activity is only a close-to-linear portion of the current-voltage relationship. The nature of this conductance is such that the presence or the absence of neuromodulators effectively regulates the amount of leak current and the input resistance in the pacemaker neurons. When deprived of neuromodulatory inputs, pyloric oscillations are disrupted; yet, a linear reduction of the total conductance in a single neuron within the pacemaker group recovers not only the pacemaker activity in that neuron, but also leads to a recovery of oscillations in the entire pyloric network. The recovered activity produces proper frequency and phasing that is similar to that induced by neuromodulators. These results show that the passive properties of pacemaker neurons can significantly affect their capacity to generate and regulate the oscillatory activity of an entire network, and that this feature is exploited by neuromodulatory inputs.},

title = {Electrical synapses between AII amacrine cells: dynamic range and functional consequences of variation in junctional conductance},
abstract = {AII amacrine cells form a network of electrically coupled interneurons in the mammalian retina and tracer coupling studies suggest that the junctional conductance (G(j)) can be modulated. However, the dynamic range of G(j) and the functional consequences of varying G(j) over the dynamic range are unknown. Here we use whole cell recordings from pairs of coupled AII amacrine cells in rat retinal slices to provide direct evidence for physiological modulation of G(j), appearing as a time-dependent increase from about 500 pS to a maximum of about 3,000 pS after 30-90 min of recording. The increase occurred in recordings with low- but not high-resistance pipettes, suggesting that it was related to intracellular washout and perturbation of a modulatory system. Computer simulations of a network of electrically coupled cells verified that our recordings were able to detect and quantify changes in G(j) over a large range. Dynamic-clamp electrophysiology, with insertion of electrical synapses between AII amacrine cells, allowed us to finely and reversibly control G(j) within the same range observed for physiologically coupled cells and to examine the quantitative relationship between G(j) and steady-state coupling coefficient, synchronization of subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations, synchronization and transmission of action potentials, and low-pass filter characteristics. The range of G(j) values over which signal transmission was modulated depended strongly on the specific functional parameter examined, with the largest range observed for action potential transmission and synchronization, suggesting that the full range of G(j) values observed during spontaneous run-up of coupling could represent a physiologically relevant dynamic range.},

It is a finite automata which is convenient for computer modelling even for large neural networks. The number of rules utilized in the finite automata are the minimum necessary to reproduce a great variety of phenomena. The validity of the model is determined using actual experimental measurements between two coupled neurons in CPG's. We reproduce, in the framework of the model, the dynamic patterns observed in Tritonia's escape swimming CPG. Finally, we study the dynamics of an open chain of 100 reciprocally coupled ''symbolic neurons'' and investigate the stable patterns reached with time.},

abstract = {In this paper, we have employed ionic models of sinoatrial node cells to investigate the synchronization of a pair of coupled cardiac pacemaker cells from central and peripheral regions of the sinoatrial node. The free-running cycle length of the cell models was perturbed using two independent techniques and the minimum coupling conductance required to achieve frequency entrainment was used to assess the relative ease with which various cell pairs achieve entrainment. The factors effecting entrainment were further investigated using single-cell models paced with an artificial biphasic coupling current. Our simulation results suggest that dissimilar cell types, those with largely different upstroke velocities entrain more easily, that is, they require less coupling conductance to achieve 1 :1 frequency entrainment. We, therefore, propose that regional variation in action-potential waveshape within the sinoatrial node assists frequency synchronization in vivo.},

title = {High Frequency, Short Latency Disinhibition Bursting of Midbrain Dopaminergic Neurons},
abstract = {During reinforcement and sequence learning, dopaminergic neurons fire bursts of action potentials. Dopaminergic neurons in vivo receive strong background excitatory and inhibitory inputs, suggesting that one mechanism by which bursts may be produced is disinhibition. Unfortunately, these inputs are lost during slice preparation and are not precisely controlled during in vivo experiments. Here we show that dopaminergic neurons can be shifted into a balanced state in which constant synaptic NMDA and GABAA conductances are mimicked either pharmacologically or using the dynamic clamp. From this state, a disinhibition burst can be evoked by removing the background inhibitory conductance. We demonstrate three functional characteristics of network-based disinhibition that promote high frequency, short latency bursting in dopaminergic neurons. First, we found that increasing the total background NMDA and GABAA synaptic conductances increased the intraburst firing frequency and reduced its latency. Second, we found that the disinhibition burst is sensitive to the proportion of background inhibitory input that is removed. In particular, we found that high frequency, short latency bursts were enhanced by increasing the degree of disinhibition. Third, the time course over which inhibition is removed had a large effect on the burst, namely that synchronous removal of weak inhibitory inputs produces bursts of high intraburst frequency and shorter latency. Our results suggest that fast, more precisely timed bursts can be evoked by complete and synchronous disinhibition of dopaminergic neurons in a high conductance state.},

title = {Direction selectivity of excitation and inhibition in simple cells of the cat primary visual cortex},
abstract = {Direction selectivity in simple cells of primary visual cortex, defined from their spike responses, cannot be predicted using linear models. It has been suggested that the shunting inhibition evoked by visual stimulation is responsible for the nonlinear component of direction selectivity. Cortical inhibition would suppress a neuron's firing when stimuli move in the nonpreferred direction, but would allow responses to stimuli in the preferred direction. Models of direction selectivity based solely on input from the lateral geniculate nucleus, however, propose that the nonlinear response is caused by spike threshold. By extracting excitatory and inhibitory components of synaptic inputs from intracellular records obtained in vivo, we demonstrate that excitation and inhibition are tuned for the same direction, but differ in relative timing. Further, membrane potential responses combine in a linear fashion. Spike threshold, however, quantitatively accounts for the nonlinear component of direction selectivity, amplifying the direction selectivity of spike output relative to that of synaptic inputs.},

title = {Ionic currents and spontaneous firing in neurons isolated from the cerebellar nuclei},
abstract = {Neurons of the cerebellar nuclei fire spontaneous action potentials both in vitro, with synaptic transmission blocked, and in vivo, in resting animals, despite ongoing inhibition from spontaneously active Purkinje neurons. We have studied the intrinsic currents of cerebellar nuclear neurons isolated from the mouse, with an interest in understanding how these currents generate spontaneous activity in the absence of synaptic input as well as how they allow firing to continue during basal levels of inhibition. Current-clamped isolated neurons fired regularly ( approximately 20 Hz), with shallow interspike hyperpolarizations (approximately -60 mV), much like neurons in more intact preparations. The spontaneous firing frequency lay in the middle of the dynamic range of the neurons and could be modulated up or down with small current injections. During step or action potential waveform voltage-clamp commands, the primary current active at interspike potentials was a tetrodotoxin-insensitive (TTX), cesium-insensitive, voltage-independent, cationic flux carried mainly by sodium ions. Although small, this cation current could depolarize neurons above threshold voltages. Voltage- and current-clamp recordings suggested a high level of inactivation of the TTX-sensitive transient sodium currents that supported action potentials. Blocking calcium currents terminated firing by preventing repolarization to normal interspike potentials, suggesting a significant role for K(Ca) currents. Potassium currents that flowed during action potential waveform voltage commands had high activation thresholds and were sensitive to 1 mm TEA. We propose that, after the decay of high-threshold potassium currents, the tonic cation current contributes strongly to the depolarization of neurons above threshold, thus maintaining the cycle of firing.},

abstract = {Gamma (gamma) oscillation, a hallmark of cortical activity during sensory processing and cognition, occurs during persistent, self-sustained activity or "UP" states, which are thought to be maintained by recurrent synaptic inputs to pyramidal cells. During neocortical "UP" states, excitatory regular spiking (RS) (pyramidal) cells and inhibitory fast spiking (FS) (basket) cells fire with distinct phase distributions relative to the gamma oscillation in the local field potential. Evidence suggests that gamma-modulated RS --> FS input serves to synchronize the interneurons and hence to generate gamma-modulated FS --> RS drive. How RS --> RS recurrent input shapes both self-sustained activity and gamma-modulated phasic firing, although, is unclear. Here, we investigate this by reconstructing gamma-modulated synaptic input to RS cells using the conductance injection (dynamic clamp) technique in cortical slices. We find that, to show lifelike gamma-modulated firing, RS cells require strongly gamma-modulated, low-latency inhibitory inputs from FS cells but little or no gamma-modulation from recurrent RS --> RS connections. We suggest that this demodulation of recurrent excitation, compared with inhibition, reflects several possible effects, including distributed propagation delays and integration of excitation over wider areas of cortex, and maximizes the capacity for representing information by the timing of recurrent excitation.},

title = {It's about time: how input timing is used and not used to create emergent properties in the auditory system},
abstract = {The hypothesis for directional selectivity of frequency modulations (FMs) invokes a mechanism with an honored tradition in sensory neurobiology, the relative timing of excitation and inhibition. The proposal is that the timing disparity is created by asymmetrical locations of excitatory tuning and inhibitory sidebands. Thus, cells in which the inhibitory sidebands are tuned to frequencies lower than the excitatory tuning are selective for downward sweeping FMs, because frequencies first generate excitation followed by inhibition. Upward sweeping FMs, in contrast, first evoke inhibition that either leads or is coincident with the excitation and prevents discharges. Here we evaluated FM directional selectivity with in vivo whole-cell recordings from the inferior colliculus of awake bats. From the whole-cell recordings, we derived synaptic conductance waveforms evoked by downward and upward FMs. We then tested the effects of shifting inhibition relative to excitation in a model and found that latency shifts had only minor effects on EPSP amplitudes that were often <1.0 mV/ms shift. However, when the PSPs peaked close to spike threshold, even small changes in latency could cause some cells to fire more strongly to a particular FM direction and thus change its directional selectivity. Furthermore, the effect of shifting inhibition depended strongly on initial latency differences and the shapes of the conductance waveforms. We conclude that "timing" is more than latency differences between excitation and inhibition, and response selectivity depends on a complex interaction between the timing, the shapes, and magnitudes of the excitatory and inhibitory conductances and spike threshold.},

title = {Activity patterns of cerebellar cortical neurones and climbing fibre afferents in the awake cat},
abstract = {1. Glass-insulated tungsten micro-electrodes were used to record from single neurones in the intermediate zone of the cerebellar cortex of cats in a state of quiet wakefulness. 2. Two hundred and seventy Purkinje (P) cells were recorded extracellularly, 95% of which displayed an irregular tonic discharge at rates between 19 and 95/s (over-all mean 44/s), including complex spikes (c.s.) which occurred at 1.0--2.5/s )over-all mean 1.5/s). The remaining cells discharged c.s. at the usual rate but only one or two simple spikes (s.s.) per minute. C.s. of spike plus wavelet and of multi-spiked type were present in approximately equal numbers of cells. 3. Presumed climbing fibre-e.p.s.p.s were recorded from fifty-six P cells and occurred both singly and in groups of two to six e.p.s.p.s at an intra-group frequency of about 500/s. The cells giving rise to the c.f.s therefore discharge propagated impulses both singly and in short bursts as previously reported for anesthetized animals. A single e.p.s.p. can give rise to more than one spike in the multi-spiked type of c.s., and probably to a complete c.s. event. 4. Following spontaneous c.s. the interval to the next s.s. varied from 8 to 600 ms. There was an inverse correlation between duration of the post-c.s. interval and the rate at which s.s. were discharged in the preceding 100 ms. The duration exceeded the mean s.s. interval provided s.s. rate was less than 40--50/s, and the post-c.s. interval would then constitute a real interruption of s.s. discharge. 5. When the superficial radial (s.r.) nerves were stimulated with single shocks too weak to produce a behavioural response changes in discharge pattern were detected in eighty-eight of 151 P cells tested. The initial responses were almost always excitatory and consisted in seventy-two cells of a c.s., in eleven of a c.s. preceded by a brief increase in s.s. and in two cases of a s.s. discharge alone. The spino-olivo-cerebellar paths responsible for the c.s. showed transmission characteristics similar to those reported for animals anaesthetized with barbiturates. 6. C.s. were readily evoked by tapping or squeezing the forepaws. 7. Excitatory responses to nerve stimulation were usually followed by a depression of the tonic s.s. discharge. Its duration ranged widely in different cells (from 10 to 500 ms) and it would coincide with equally variable periods of facilitation previously seen in neurones of nucleus interpositus. It is therefore likely that such facilitations of the cerebellar nuclear cells result at least in part from reductions in the tonic inhibitory input from the P cells. 8. Thirty-six units were classes as 'probable cortical interneurones'. They discharged more regularly, at rates between 9 and 28/s. Twenty such units (56%) responded to s.r. stimulation with a brief excitation not usually followed by any pronounced depression.},

title = {Dynamical State and Parameter Estimation},
abstract = {We discuss the problem of determining unknown fixed parameters and unobserved state variables in nonlinear models of a dynamical system using observed time series data from that system. In dynamical terms this requires synchronization of the experimental data with time series output from a model. If the model and the experimental system are chaotic, the synchronization manifold, where the data time series is equal to the model time series, may be unstable. If this occurs, then small perturbations in parameters or state variables can lead to large excursions near the synchronization manifold and produce a very complex surface in any estimation metric for those quantities. Coupling the experimental information to the model dynamics can lead to a stabilization of this manifold by reducing a positive conditional Lyapunov exponent (CLE) to a negative value. An approach called dynamical parameter estimation (DPE) addresses these instabilities and regularizes them, allowing for smooth surfaces in the space of parameters and initial conditions. DPE acts as an observer in the control systems sense, and because the control is systematically removed through an optimization process, it acts as an estimator of the unknown model parameters for the desired physical model without external control. Examples are given from several systems including an electronic oscillator, a neuron model, and a very simple geophysical model. In networks and larger dynamical models one may encounter many positive CLEs, and we investigate a general approach for estimating fixed model parameters and unobserved system states in this situation.},

abstract = {Dynamic clamp is a powerful method that allows the introduction of artificial electrical components into target cells to simulate ionic conductances and synaptic inputs. This method is based on a fast cycle of measuring the membrane potential of a cell, calculating the current of a desired simulated component using an appropriate model and injecting this current into the cell. Here we present a dynamic clamp protocol using free, fully integrated, open-source software (StdpC, for spike timing-dependent plasticity clamp). Use of this protocol does not require specialist hardware, costly commercial software, experience in real-time operating systems or a strong programming background. The software enables the configuration and operation of a wide range of complex and fully automated dynamic clamp experiments through an intuitive and powerful interface with a minimal initial lead time of a few hours. After initial configuration, experimental results can be generated within minutes of establishing cell recording.},

title = {Dynamic influences on coincidence detection in neocortical pyramidal neurons},
abstract = {The firing rate of neocortical pyramidal neurons is believed to represent primarily the average arrival rate of synaptic inputs; however, it has also been found to vary somewhat depending on the degree of synchrony among synaptic inputs. We investigated the ability of pyramidal neurons to perform coincidence detection, that is, to represent input timing in their firing rate, and explored some factors that influence that representation. We injected computer-generated simulated synaptic inputs into pyramidal neurons during whole-cell recordings, systematically altering the phase delay between two groups of periodic simulated input events. We explored how input intensity, the synaptic time course, inhibitory synaptic conductance, and input jitter influenced the firing rate representation of input timing. In agreement with computer modeling studies, we found that input synchronization increases firing rate when intensity is low but reduces firing rate when intensity is high. At high intensity, the effect of synchrony on firing rate could be switched from reducing to increasing firing rate by shortening the simulated excitatory synaptic time course, adding inhibition (using the dynamic clamp technique), or introducing a small input jitter. These opposite effects of synchrony may serve different computational functions: as a means of increasing firing rate it may be useful for efficient recruitment or for computing a continuous parameter, whereas as a means of decreasing firing rate it may provide gain control, which would allow redundant or excessive input to be ignored. Modulation of dynamic input properties may allow neurons to perform different operations depending on the task at hand.},

abstract = {We describe a system for real-time control of biological and other experiments. This device, based around the Real-Time Linux operating system, was tested specifically in the context of dynamic clamping, a demanding real-time task in which a computational system mimics the effects of nonlinear membrane conductances in living cells. The system is fast enough to represent dozens of nonlinear conductances in real time at clock rates well above 10 kHz. Conductances can be represented in deterministic form, or more accurately as discrete collections of stochastically gating ion channels. Tests were performed using a variety of complex models of nonlinear membrane mechanisms in excitable cells, including simulations of spatially extended excitable structures, and multiple interacting cells. Only in extreme cases does the computational load interfere with high-speed "hard" real-time processing (i.e., real-time processing that never falters). Freely available on the worldwide web, this experimental control system combines good performance. immense flexibility, low cost, and reasonable ease of use. It is easily adapted to any task involving real-time control, and excels in particular for applications requiring complex control algorithms that must operate at speeds over 1 kHz.},

abstract = {The hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I(h)) may influence precise auditory processing by modulating resting membrane potential and cell excitability. We used electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry to investigate the properties of I(h) in three auditory brainstem nuclei in mice: the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN), the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and the lateral superior olive (LSO). I(h) amplitude varied considerably between these cell types, with the order of magnitude LSO > AVCN > MNTB. Kinetically, I(h) is faster in LSO neurons, and more active at rest, compared with AVCN and MNTB cells. The half-activation voltage is -10 mV more hyperpolarized for AVCN and MNTB cells compared with LSO neurons. HCN1 immunoreactivity strongly labelled AVCN and LSO neurons, while HCN2 staining was more diffuse in all nuclei. The HCN4 subunit displayed robust membrane staining in AVCN and MNTB cells but weak labelling of the LSO. We used a dynamic clamp, after blocking I(h), to reinsert I(h) to the different cell types. Our results indicate that the native I(h) for each cell type influences the resting membrane potential and can delay the generation of action potentials in response to injected current. Native I(h) increases rebound depolarizations following hyperpolarizations in all cell types, and increases the likelihood of rebound action potentials (particularly in multiple-firing LSO neurons). This systematic comparison shows that I(h) characteristics vary considerably between different brainstem nuclei, and that these differences significantly affect the response properties of cells within these nuclei.},

title = {Synaptic background noise controls the input/output characteristics of single cells in an in vitro model of in vivo activity},
abstract = {In vivo, in vitro and computational studies were used to investigate the impact of the synaptic background activity observed in neocortical neurons in vivo. We simulated background activity in vitro using two stochastic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes describing glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic conductances, which were injected into a cell in real time using the dynamic clamp technique. With parameters chosen to mimic in vivo conditions, layer 5 rat prefrontal cortex cells recorded in vitro were depolarized by about 15 mV, their membrane fluctuated with a S.D. of about 4 mV, their input resistances decreased five-fold, their spontaneous firing had a high coefficient of variation and an average firing rate of about 5-10 Hz. Brief changes in the variance of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) synaptic conductance fluctuations induced time-locked spiking without significantly changing the average membrane potential of the cell. These transients mimicked increases in the correlation of excitatory inputs. Background activity was highly effective in modulating the firing-rate/current curve of the cell: the variance of the simulated gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and AMPA conductances individually set the input/output gain, the mean excitatory and inhibitory conductances set the working point, and the mean inhibitory conductance controlled the input resistance. An average ratio of inhibitory to excitatory mean conductances close to 4 was optimal in generating membrane potential fluctuations with high coefficients of variation. We conclude that background synaptic activity can dynamically modulate the input/output properties of individual neocortical neurons in vivo.},

abstract = {Purkinje neurons spontaneously generate action potentials in the absence of synaptic drive and thereby exert a tonic, yet plastic, input to their target cells in the deep cerebellar nuclei. Purkinje neurons express two ionic currents with biophysical properties that are specialized for high-frequency firing: resurgent sodium currents and potassium currents mediated by Kv3.3. How these ionic currents determine the intrinsic activity of Purkinje neurons has only partially been understood. Purkinje neurons from mutant mice lacking Kv3.3 have a reduced rate of spontaneous firing. Dynamic-clamp recordings demonstrated that normal firing rates are rescued by inserting artificial Kv3 currents into Kv3.3 knock-out Purkinje neurons. Numerical simulations indicated that Kv3.3 increases the spontaneous firing rate via cooperation with resurgent sodium currents. We conclude that the rate of spontaneous action potential firing of Purkinje neurons is controlled by the interaction of Kv3.3 potassium currents and resurgent sodium currents.},

title = {Feedback inhibition controls spike transfer in hybrid thalamic circuits},
abstract = {Sensory information reaches the cerebral cortex through the thalamus, which differentially relays this input depending on the state of arousal(1-5). Such 'gating' involves inhibition of the thalamocortical relay neurons by the reticular nucleus of the thalamus(6-8), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We reconstructed the thalamocortical circuit as an artificial and biological hybrid network in vitro. With visual input simulated as retinal cell activity, we show here that when the gain in the thalamic inhibitory feedback loop is greater than a critical value, the circuit tends towards oscillations-and thus imposes a temporal decorrelation of retinal cell input and thalamic relay output. This results in the functional disconnection of the cortex from the sensory drive, a feature typical of sleep states. Conversely, low gain in the feedback inhibition and the action of noradrenaline, a known modulator of arousal(4,9,10), converge to increase input-output correlation in relay neurons. Combining gain control of feedback inhibition and modulation of membrane excitability thus enables thalamic circuits to finely tune the gating of spike transmission from sensory organs to the cortex.},

Blockade of the persistent sodium current (I(NaP)), which was postulated to underlie voltage-dependent bursting in respiratory pacemaker neurons, with riluzole (< or =200 microM) did not alter the frequency of respiratory-related motor output. Yet, in every pacemaker neuron recorded (50/50), bursting was abolished at much lower concentrations of riluzole (< or =20 microM). Thus, eliminating the pacemaker population (our statistics confirm that this population is reduced at least 94%, p < 0.05) does not affect respiratory rhythm. These results suggest that voltage-dependent bursting in pacemaker neurons is not essential for respiratory rhythmogenesis, which may instead be an emergent network property.},

Unlike previous models, bursting is driven by the interaction of two slow processes, one with a relatively small time constant (1-5 s) and the other with a much larger time constant (1-2 min). Bursting on the intermediate time scale is generated without need for a slow process having an intermediate time constant, hence phantom bursting. The model suggests that isolated cells exhibiting a fast pattern may nonetheless possess slower processes that can be brought out by injecting suitable exogenous currents. Guided by this, we devise an experimental protocol using the dynamic clamp technique that reliably elicits islet-like, medium period oscillations from isolated cells. Finally, we show that strong electrical coupling between a fast burster and a slow burster can produce synchronized medium bursting, suggesting that islets may be composed of cells that are intrinsically either fast or slow, with few or none that are intrinsically medium.},

abstract = {According to Barlow's seminal "efficient coding hypothesis," the coding strategy of sensory neurons should be matched to the statistics of stimuli that occur in an animal's natural habitat. Using an automatic search technique, we here test this hypothesis and identify stimulus ensembles that sensory neurons are optimized for. Focusing on grasshopper auditory receptor neurons, we find that their optimal stimulus ensembles differ from the natural environment, but largely overlap with a behaviorally important sub-ensemble of the natural sounds. This indicates that the receptors are optimized for peak rather than average performance. More generally, our results suggest that the coding strategies of sensory neurons are heavily influenced by differences in behavioral relevance among natural stimuli.},

This can even occur when there are no obvious signs of poor spatial control. We evaluated this error for experiments that employ an isochronal I(V) approach to analyzing clamp currents. Simulated voltage clamp experiments were run on a model neuron having a uniform distribution of a single voltage-gated inactivating ionic current channel along an elongate, but electrotonically compact, process. Isochronal Boltzmann I(V) and kinetic parameter values obtained by fitting the Hodgkin-Huxley equations to the clamp currents were compared with the values originally set in the model. Good fits were obtained for both inward and outward currents for moderate channel densities. Most parameter errors increased with conductance density. The activation rate parameters were more sensitive to poor space clamp than the I(V) parameters. Large errors can occur despite "normal"-looking clamp curves.},

title = {Gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor-dependent burst-firing in thalamic neurons: a dynamic clamp study},
abstract = {Synchronized network responses in thalamus depend on phasic inhibition originating in the thalamic reticular nucleus (nRt) and are mediated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). A suggested role for intra-nRt connectivity in inhibitory phasing remains controversial. Recently, functional GABA type B (GABAB) receptors were demonstrated on nRt cells, and the slow time course of the GABAB synaptic response seems ideally suited to deinactivate low-threshold calcium channels. This promotes burst firing, a characteristic feature of synchronized responses. Here we investigate GABAB-mediated rebound burst firing in thalamic cells. Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were obtained from nRt cells and somatosensory thalamocortical relay cells in rat brain slices. Synthetic GABAB inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, generated by a hybrid computerneuron synapse (dynamic clamp), triggered rebound low-threshold calcium spikes in both cell types when peak inhibitory postsynaptic potential hyperpolarization was greater than -92 mV. The threshold inhibitory postsynaptic potential conductance for rebound burst generation was comparable in nRt (7 nS) and thalamocortical (5 nS) cells. However, burst onset in nRt (1 s) was considerably delayed compared with thalamocortical (0.6 s) cells. Thus, GABAB inhibitory postsynaptic potentials can elicit low-threshold calcium spikes in both relay and nRt neurons, but the resultant oscillation frequency would be faster for thalamocortical-nRt networks (3 Hz) than for nRt-nRt networks (1-2 Hz). We conclude, therefore, that fast (> 2 Hz) GABAB-dependent thalamic oscillations are maintained primarily by reciprocal connections between excitatory and inhibitory cells. These findings further indicate that when oscillatory neural networks contain both recurrent and reciprocal inhibition, then distinct population frequencies may result when one or the other type of inhibition is favored.},

abstract = {In olfactory mitral cells, dual patch recordings show that the site of action potential initiation can shift between soma and distal primary dendrite and that the shift is dependent on the location and strength of electrode current injection. We have analyzed the mechanisms underlying this shift, using a model of the mitral cell that takes advantage of the constraints available from the two recording sites. Starting with homogeneous Hodgkin-Huxley-like Na+-K+ channel distribution in the soma-dendritic region and much higher sodium channel density in the axonal region, the model's channel kinetics and density were adjusted by a fitting algorithm so that the model response was virtually identical to the experimental data. The combination of loading effects and much higher sodium channel density in the axon relative to the soma-dendritic region results in significantly lower "voltage threshold" for action potential initiation in the axon; the axon therefore fires first unless the voltage gradient in the primary dendrite is steep enough for it to reach its higher threshold. The results thus provide a quantitative explanation for the stimulus strength and position dependence of the site of action potential initiation in the mitral cell.},

Nervous systems contain numerous amines and neuropeptides that function to both modulate the strength of synaptic connections and the intrinsic properties of network neurons. Consequently network dynamics can be tuned and configured in different ways, as a function of the actions of neuromodulators. General principles of the organization of modulatory systems in nervous systems include: (a) many neurons and networks are multiply modulated, (b) there is extensive convergence and divergence in modulator action, and (c) some modulators may be released extrinsically to the modulated circuit, while others may be released by some of the circuit neurons themselves, and act intrinsically. Some of the computational consequences of these features of modulator action are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We apply these methods to single-neuron spike train data recorded from the auditory midbrain of zebra finches, and demonstrate that the resulting stimulus sequences do in fact provide more information about neuronal tuning in a shorter amount of time than do more standard experimental designs. },

title = {Encoding of brain state changes in local field potentials modulated by motor behaviors},
abstract = {Local field potentials (LFPs) measure aggregate neural activity resulting from the coordinated firing of neurons within a local network. We hypothesized that state parameters associated with the underlying brain dynamics may be encoded in LFPs but may not be directly measurable in the signal temporal and spectral contents. Using the Kalman filter we estimated latent state changes in LFPs recorded in monkey motor cortical areas during the execution of a visually instructed reaching task, under different applied force conditions. Prior to the estimation, matched filtering was performed to decouple behavior-relevant signals (Stamoulis and Richardson, J Comput Neurosci, 2009) from unrelated background oscillations. State changes associated with baseline oscillations appeared insignificant. In contrast, state changes estimated from LFP components associated with the execution of movement were significant. Approximately direction-invariant state vectors were consistently observed. Their patterns appeared invariant also to force field conditions, with a peak in the first 200 ms of the movement interval, but exponentially decreasing to the zero state approximately 200 ms from movement onset, also the time at which movement velocity reached its peak. Thus, state appeared to be modulated by the dynamics of movement but neither by movement direction nor by the mechanical environment. Finally, we compared state vectors estimated using the Kalman filter to the basis functions obtained through Principal Component Analysis. The pattern of the estimated state vector was very similar to that of the first PCA component, further suggesting that LFPs may directly encode brain state fluctuations associated with the dynamics of behavior.},

title = {A spectral-analysis of the integration of artificial synaptic potentials in mammalian central neurons},
abstract = {In order to simulate the interaction between synaptic input and intrinsic membrane properties in mammalian central neurons a well-defined current was injected into the neurons through a recording electrode. The stimulus was white noise bandpass filtered at 0.5 and 75 Hz and the power spectra of the responses were calculated. Recordings were obtained from neurons of the neocortex, the hippocampus, the thalamus and the cerebellar cortex. The neurons were either located in newly cut slices from adult guinea pig brains or in 3-10-weeks-old slice cultures from brains of newborn rats. In hippocampal and cortical cells the passive membrane properties dominated the shape of the power spectra. In general, when the average membrane potential was made more positive the power of the response increased. When neurons had active subthreshold responses like delayed rectification, sag-and-hump responses or delayed depolarization there was a depression of the response power at frequencies below 10-20 Hz. The depression was voltage dependent in the same way as the Current that produced the active subthreshold response. In thalamic cells with a low-threshold Ca2+ spike (Its) the power of the responses grew in the 3-20-Hz range with hyperpolarization. The spectra of the responses of thalamic neurons had multiple peaks indicating multiple frequencies of resonance. Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex have prominent plateau potentials. When these cells were stimulated with the white noise at levels where the plateau potentials could be activated the spectra were dominated by a large peak at the lowest frequencies, i.e., below 5 Hz. Few cells in our data base generated spontaneous membrane potential oscillations. When the current stimulus was injected into such neurons the intrinsic rhythm was unaffected by the input and the power spectrum showed a marked peak at the frequency of the intrinsic oscillations. We conclude that bandpass filtered white noise as simulation of synaptic input is valuable for quantification of how passive and active membrane properties affect synaptic integration. The technique can also provide information on the role of transmitters and modulators in the CNS.},

title = {Electrical interactions between a rabbit atrial cell and a nodal cell model},
abstract = {Atrial activation involves interactions between cells with automaticity and slow-response action potentials with cells that are intrinsically quiescent with fast-response action potentials. Understanding normal and abnormal atrial activity requires an understanding of this process. We studied interactions of a cell with spontaneous activity, represented by a "real-time" simulation of a model of the rabbit sinoatrial (SA) node cell, simultaneously being electrically coupled via our "coupling clamp" circuit to a real, isolated atrial myocyte with variations in coupling conductance (G(c)) or stimulus frequency. The atrial cells were able to be driven at a regular rate by a single SA node model (SAN model) cell. Critical G(c) for entrainment of the SAN model cell to a nonstimulated atrial cell was 0.55 +/- 0.05 nS (n = 7), and the critical G(c) that allowed entrainment when the atrial cell was directly paced at a basic cycle length of 300 ms was 0.32 +/- 0.01 nS (n = 7). For each atrial cell we found periodic phenomena of synchronization other than 1:1 entrainment when G(c) was between 0.1 and 0.3 nS, below the value required for frequency entrainment, when the atrial cell was directly driven at a basic cycle length of either 300 or 600 ms. In conclusion, the high input resistance of the atrial cells allows successful entrainment of nodal and atrial cells at low values of G(c), but further uncoupling produces arrhythmic interactions.},

title = {Reduction of spike afterdepolarization by increased leak conductance alters interspike interval variability},
abstract = {Data from neurons in vivo have shown that spike output can often sustain episodes of high variability. Theoretical studies have indicated that the high conductance state of neurons brought on by synaptic activity can contribute to an increase in the variability of spike output by decreasing the integration timescale of the neuron. In the present work, we were interested in understanding how background synaptic conductance activity alters the interspike interval (ISI) variability of layer III pyramidal cells of the medial entorhinal cortex. We compared ISI variability in pyramidal cells as a result of synaptic current- or conductance-mediated membrane fluctuations. We found that the effects of background synaptic conductance activity on ISI variability depend on the neuron type. In pyramidal cells lacking spike frequency adaptation, the variability increased in relation to a comparable synaptic current stimulus. In contrast, in pyramidal cells displaying spike frequency adaptation, the synaptic conductance stimulus produced lower ISI variability. To understand this result, we constructed a phenomenological model that reproduced the basic properties of these neurons under control and increased leak conductance. We found that leak can change the properties of the neuron by acting as a bifurcation parameter that reduces the afterdepolarization (ADP) and decreases the slope (gain) of the frequency-current relationship, particularly for transient stimuli. A lower gain with the added leak causes a reduction in ISI variability. We conclude that the ability of a high conductance state to increase ISI variability cannot be generalized and can depend on the spike ADP dynamics expressed by the neuron.},

title = {Intrinsic and synaptic dynamics interact to generate emergent patterns of rhythmic bursting in thalamocortical neurons},
abstract = {Rhythmic inhibition entrains the firing of excitatory neurons during oscillations throughout the brain. Previous work has suggested that the strength and duration of inhibitory input determines the synchrony and period, respectively, of these oscillations. In particular, sleep spindles result from a cycle of events including rhythmic inhibition and rebound bursts in thalamocortical (TC) neurons, and slowing and strengthening this inhibitory input may transform spindles into spike-wave discharges characteristic of absence epilepsy. Here, we used dynamic clamp to inject TC neurons with spindle-like trains of IPSCs and studied how modest changes in the amplitude and/or duration of these IPSCs affected the responses of the TC neurons. Contrary to our expectations, we found that prolonging IPSCs accelerates postinhibitory rebound (PIR) in TC neurons, and that increasing either the amplitude or duration of IPSCs desynchronizes PIR activity in a population of TC cells. Tonic injection of hyperpolarizing or depolarizing current dramatically alters the timing and synchrony of PIR. These results demonstrate that rhythmic PIR activity is an emergent property of interactions between intrinsic and synaptic currents, not just a passive reflection of incoming synaptic inhibition.},

title = {A paradoxical isopotentiality: a spatially uniform noise spectrum in neocortical pyramidal cells},
abstract = {Membrane ion channels and synapses are among the most important computational elements of nerve cells. Both have stochastic components that are reflected in random fluctuations of the membrane potential. We measured the spectral characteristics of membrane voltage noise in vitro at the soma and the apical dendrite of layer 4/5 (L4/5) neocortical neurons of rats near the resting potential. We found a remarkable similarity between the voltage noise power spectra at the soma and the dendrites, despite a marked difference in their respective input impedances. At both sites, the noise levels and the input impedance are voltage dependent; in the soma, the noise level increased from sigma = 0.33 +/- 0.28 mV at 10 mV hyperpolarization from the resting potential to sigma = 0.59 +/- 0.3 at a depolarization of 10 mV. At the dendrite, the noise increased from sigma = 0.34 +/- 0.28 to sigma = 0.56 +/- 0.30 mV, respectively. TTX reduced both the input impedance and the voltage noise, and eliminated their voltage dependence at both locations. We describe a detailed compartmental model of a L4/5 neuron with simplified electrical properties that successfully reproduces the difference in input impedance between dendrites and soma and demonstrates that spatially uniform conductance-base noise sources leads to an apparent isopotential structure which exhibits a uniform power spectra of voltage noise at all locations. We speculate that a homogeneous distribution of noise sources insures that variability in synaptic amplitude as well as timing of action potentials is location invariant.},

abstract = {In cortical neurones, analogue dendritic potentials are thought to be encoded into patterns of digital spikes. According to this view, neuronal codes and computations are based on the temporal patterns of spikes: spike times, bursts or spike rates. Recently, we proposed an 'action potential waveform code' for cortical pyramidal neurones in which the spike shape carries information. Broader somatic action potentials are reliably produced in response to higher conductance input, allowing for four times more information transfer than spike times alone. This information is preserved during synaptic integration in a single neurone, as back-propagating action potentials of diverse shapes differentially shunt incoming postsynaptic potentials and so participate in the next round of spike generation. An open question has been whether the information in action potential waveforms can also survive axonal conduction and directly influence synaptic transmission to neighbouring neurones. Several new findings have now brought new light to this subject, showing cortical information processing that transcends the classical models.},

title = {The quantitative single-neuron modeling competition},
abstract = {As large-scale, detailed network modeling projects are flourishing in the field of computational neuroscience, it is more and more important to design single neuron models that not only capture qualitative features of real neurons but are quantitatively accurate in silico representations of those. Recent years have seen substantial effort being put in the development of algorithms for the systematic evaluation and optimization of neuron models with respect to electrophysiological data. It is however difficult to compare these methods because of the lack of appropriate benchmark tests. Here, we describe one such effort of providing the community with a standardized set of tests to quantify the performances of single neuron models. Our effort takes the form of a yearly challenge similar to the ones which have been present in the machine learning community for some time. This paper gives an account of the first two challenges which took place in 2007 and 2008 and discusses future directions. The results of the competition suggest that best performance on data obtained from single or double electrode current or conductance injection is achieved by models that combine features of standard leaky integrate-and-fire models with a second variable reflecting adaptation, refractoriness, or a dynamic threshold.},

title = {Homeostatic regulation of M-current modulates synaptic integration in secretomotor, but not vasomotor, sympathetic neurons in the bullfrog},
abstract = {We compared how vasomotor C neurons and secretomotor B neurons integrated identical patterns of virtual synaptic activity using dynamic clamp, perforated-patch recordings from dissociated bullfrog sympathetic ganglion cells. The synaptic template modelled one strong nicotinic synapse and nine weak synapses, each firing randomly at 5 Hz, with strength normalized to each cell. B neurons initially fired at 12 Hz, but this declined within seconds, decreasing 27% after 40 s and recovering slowly as evidenced by the threshold synaptic conductance for firing (tau(recovery) = 136 + or - 23 s). C neurons gave an identical initial response that remained steady, declining only 6% after 40 s. The difference resulted from an activity-dependent 379 + or - 65% increase in M-current (I(M)) in B cells (tau(recovery) = 153 + or - 22 s), which was absent in C cells. In addition, action potential afterhyperpolarizations were 2-fold longer in B cells, but this did not produce the differential response to synaptic stimulation. Activity-dependent increases in I(M) were sensitive to 100 microm Cd(2+) and 2.5 microm oxotremorine M (oxo-M), a muscarinic agonist, and fully blocked by zero Ca(2+), 10 microm oxo-M and 2.5 microm oxo-M plus 50 microm wortmannin, a PIP(2) synthesis inhibitor. A leftward shift in voltage-dependent activation could not fully account for the I(M) increase. Firing at 0.5 Hz was sufficient to modulate I(M). Opposing influences of activity and muscarinic excitation thus produce homeostatic I(M) regulation, to stabilize excitability and postsynaptic output in secretomotor sympathetic neurons. Absence of this regulation in vasomotor neurons suggests a different integrative function, where synaptic gain increases in proportion to presynaptic activity.},

title = {Modulatory effects of serotonin on GABAergic synaptic transmission and membrane properties in the deep cerebellar nuclei},
abstract = {Cerebellar outputs from the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) are critical for generating and controlling movement. DCN neuronal activity is primarily controlled by GABAergic inhibitory transmission by Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex and is also modulated by nerve inputs originating from other brain regions within and outside the cerebellum. In this study, we examined the modulatory effects of 5-HT on GABAergic synapses in the DCN. 5-HT decreased the amplitude of stimulation-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) in DCN neurons, and this effect was abolished by a 5-HT(1B) antagonist, SB 224289. The decrease in IPSC amplitude was associated with an increased paired-pulse ratio of the IPSC. 5-HT also decreased the frequency of miniature IPSCs without altering the amplitude. These data suggest that 5-HT presynaptically inhibited GABA release. Furthermore, 5-HT elicited a slow inward current in DCN neurons. Pharmacological studies showed that 5-HT activated the 5-HT(5) receptor, which is positively coupled to G protein and elicited the slow inward current through enhancement of hyperpolarization-activated cation channel activation. Finally, we examined the effects of 5-HT on the spike generation that accompanies repetitive stimulation of inhibitory synapses. 5-HT increased the spontaneous firing rate in DCN neurons caused by depolarization. Increase in the 5-HT-induced tonic firing relatively decreased the contrast difference from the rebound depolarization-induced firing. However, the inhibitory transmission-induced silencing of DCN firing remained during the conditioning stimulus. These results suggest that 5-HT plays a regulatory role in spike generation and contributes to the gain control of inhibitory GABAergic synapses in DCN neurons.},

abstract = {The electrical activity of individual neurons and neuronal networks is shaped by the complex interplay of a large number of non-linear processes, including the voltage-dependent gating of ion channels and the activation of synaptic receptors. These complex dynamics make it difficult to understand how individual neuron or network parameters-such as the number of ion channels of a given type in a neuron's membrane or the strength of a particular synapse-influence neural system function. Systematic exploration of cellular or network model parameter spaces by computational brute force can overcome this difficulty and generate comprehensive data sets that contain information about neuron or network behavior for many different combinations of parameters. Searching such data sets for parameter combinations that produce functional neuron or network output provides insights into how narrowly different neural system parameters have to be tuned to produce a desired behavior. This chapter describes the construction and analysis of databases of neuron or neuronal network models and describes some of the advantages and downsides of such exploration methods.},

We examined synaptic and intrinsic membrane properties that generate inspiratory drive potentials in preB{\"o}tC neurons using neonatal mouse medullary slice preparations that generate respiratory rhythm. We found that NMDA receptors, group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), but not group II mGluRs, contributed to inspiratory drive potentials. Subtype 1 of the group I mGluR family (mGluR1) probably regulates a K+ channel, whereas mGluR5 operates via an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor-dependent mechanism to augment drive potential generation. We tested for and verified the presence of a Ca2+-activated non-specific cation current (I(CAN)) in preB{\"o}tC neurons. We also found that high concentrations of intracellular BAPTA, a high-affinity Ca2+ chelator, and the I(CAN) antagonist flufenamic acid (FFA) decreased the magnitude of drive potentials. We conclude that I(CAN) underlies robust inspiratory drive potentials in preB{\"o}tC neurons, and is only fully evoked by ionotropic and metabotropic glutamatergic synaptic inputs, i.e. by network activity.},

title = {Noise correlations improve response fidelity and stimulus encoding},
abstract = {Computation in the nervous system often relies on the integration of signals from parallel circuits with different functional properties. Correlated noise in these inputs can, in principle, have diverse and dramatic effects on the reliability of the resulting computations. Such theoretical predictions have rarely been tested experimentally because of a scarcity of preparations that permit measurement of both the covariation of a neuron's input signals and the effect on a cell's output of manipulating such covariation. Here we introduce a method to measure covariation of the excitatory and inhibitory inputs a cell receives. This method revealed strong correlated noise in the inputs to two types of retinal ganglion cell. Eliminating correlated noise without changing other input properties substantially decreased the accuracy with which a cell's spike outputs encoded light inputs. Thus, covariation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs can be a critical determinant of the reliability of neural coding and computation.},

title = {Quantal events shape cerebellar interneuron firing},
abstract = {Many small synaptic inputs or one large input are needed to influence principal cell firing, whereas individual quanta exert little influence. However, the role of a quantum may be greater for small interneurons with high input resistances. Using dynamic clamp recordings, we found that individual quanta strongly influence rat cerebellar stellate cell firing. When the frequency of synaptic inputs was low, the timing of recent spikes regulated the influence of excitatory quanta. In contrast, when input frequency was high, spike timing was less important than interactions with other inputs. Inhibitory quanta rapidly terminated firing, whereas small numbers of coincident excitatory quanta reliably and rapidly triggered firing. Our results suggest that stellate cells achieve temporal precision through coincidence detection and disynaptic inhibition, despite their high resistances and long membrane time constants. Thus, we propose that small interneurons can process synaptic inputs in a fundamentally different way from principal cells.},

title = {Interactions of persistent sodium and calcium-activated nonspecific cationic currents yield dynamically distinct bursting regimes in a model of respiratory neurons},
abstract = {The preB{\"o}tzinger complex (preB{\"o}tC) is a heterogeneous neuronal network within the mammalian brainstem that has been experimentally found to generate robust, synchronous bursts that drive the inspiratory phase of the respiratory rhythm. The persistent sodium (NaP) current is observed in every preB{\"o}tC neuron, and significant modeling effort has characterized its contribution to square-wave bursting in the preB{\"o}tC. Recent experimental work demonstrated that neurons within the preB{\"o}tC are endowed with a calcium-activated nonspecific cationic (CAN) current that is activated by a signaling cascade initiated by glutamate. In a preB{\"o}tC model, the CAN current was shown to promote robust bursts that experience depolarization block (DB bursts). We consider a self-coupled model neuron, which we represent as a single compartment based on our experimental finding of electrotonic compactness, under variation of g (NaP), the conductance of the NaP current, and g (CAN), the conductance of the CAN current. Varying these two conductances yields a spectrum of activity patterns, including quiescence, tonic activity, square-wave bursting, DB bursting, and a novel mixture of square-wave and DB bursts, which match well with activity that we observe in experimental preparations. We elucidate the mechanisms underlying these dynamics, as well as the transitions between these regimes and the occurrence of bistability, by applying the mathematical tools of bifurcation analysis and slow-fast decomposition. Based on the prevalence of NaP and CAN currents, we expect that the generalizable framework for modeling their interactions that we present may be relevant to the rhythmicity of other brain areas beyond the preB{\"o}tC as well.},

abstract = {The neuropeptide allatostatin decreases the spike rate in response to time-varying stretches of two different crustacean mechanoreceptors, the gastropyloric receptor 2 in the crab Cancer borealis and the coxobasal chordotonal organ (CBCTO) in the crab Carcinus maenas. In each system, the decrease in firing rate is accompanied by an increase in the timing precision of spikes triggered by discrete temporal features in the stimulus. This was quantified by calculating the standard deviation or "jitter" in the times of individual identified spikes elicited in response to repeated presentations of the stimulus. Conversely, serotonin increases the firing rate but decreases the timing precision of the CBCTO response. Intracellular recordings from the afferents of this receptor demonstrate that allatostatin increases the conductance of the neurons, consistent with its inhibitory action on spike rate, whereas serotonin decreases the overall membrane conductance. We conclude that spike-timing precision of mechanoreceptor afferents in response to dynamic stimulation can be altered by neuromodulators acting directly on the afferent neurons.},

title = {How shunting inhibition affects the discharge of lumbar motoneurones: a dynamic clamp study in anaesthetized cats},
abstract = {In the present work, dynamic clamp was used to inject a current that mimicked tonic synaptic activity in the soma of cat lumbar motoneurones with a microelectrode. The reversal potential of this current could be set at the resting potential so as to prevent membrane depolarization or hyperpolarization. The only effect of the dynamic clamp was then to elicit a constant and calibrated increase of the motoneurone input conductance. The effect of the resulting shunt was investigated on repetitive discharges elicited by current pulses. Shunting inhibition reduced very substantially the firing frequency in the primary range without changing the slope of the current-frequency curves. The shift of the I-f curve was proportional to the conductance increase imposed by the dynamic clamp and depended on an intrinsic property of the motoneurone that we called the shunt potential. The shunt potential ranged between 11 and 37 mV above the resting potential, indicating that the sensitivity of motoneurones to shunting inhibition was quite variable. The shunt potential was always near or above the action potential voltage threshold. A theoretical model allowed us to interpret these experimental results. The shunt potential was shown to be a weighted time average of membrane voltage. The weighting factor is the phase response function of the neurone that peaks at the end of the interspike interval. The shunt potential indicates whether mixed synaptic inputs have an excitatory or inhibitory effect on the ongoing discharge of the motoneurone.},

The current-induced fluorescence signal (DeltaF/F) of the HVA current was five times higher then the LVA-induced signal at the soma, but both signals were approximately equal in size in distant dendrites. This position-dependent shift of DeltaF/F indicates a non-uniform distribution of the underlying calcium channels. The higher weight of the LVA signal in the dendrites suggests that the LVA might be of particular relevance for the dendritic integration of synaptic inputs.},

title = {Synaptic modulation of the interspike interval signatures of bursting pyloric neurons},
abstract = {The pyloric network of the lobster stomatogastric nervous system is one of the best described assemblies of oscillatory neurons producing bursts of action potentials. While the temporal patterns of bursts have been investigated in detail, those of spikes have received less attention. Here we analyze the intraburst firing patterns of pyloric neurons and the synaptic interactions shaping their dynamics in millisecond time scales not performed before. We find that different pyloric neurons express characteristic, cell-specific firing patterns in their bursts. Nonlinear analysis of the interspike intervals (ISIs) reveals distinctive temporal structures ('interspike interval signatures'), which are found to depend on the synaptic connectivity of the network. We compare ISI patterns of the pyloric dilator (PD), lateral pyloric (LP), and ventricular dilator (VD) neurons in 1) normal conditions, 2) after blocking glutamatergic synaptic connections, and 3) in various functional configurations of the three neurons. Manipulation of the synaptic connectivity results in characteristic changes in the ISI signatures of the postsynaptic neurons. The intraburst firing pattern of the PD neuron is regularized by the inhibitory synaptic connection from the LP neuron as revealed in current-clamp experiments and also as reconstructed with a dynamic clamp. On the other hand, mutual inhibition between the LP and VD neurons tend to produce more irregular bursts with increased spike jitter. The results show that synaptic interactions fine-tune the output of pyloric neurons. The present data also suggest a way of processing of synaptic information: bursting neurons are capable of encoding incoming signals by altering the fine structure of their intraburst spike patterns.},

However, common methods for performing inference in state-space models with non-Gaussian observations rely on certain approximations which are not always accurate. Here we review direct optimization methods that avoid these approximations, but that nonetheless retain the computational efficiency of the approximate methods. We discuss a variety of examples, applying these direct optimization techniques to problems in spike train smoothing, stimulus decoding, parameter estimation, and inference of synaptic properties. Along the way, we point out connections to some related standard statistical methods, including spline smoothing and isotonic regression. Finally, we note that the computational methods reviewed here do not in fact depend on the state-space setting at all; instead, the key property we are exploiting involves the bandedness of certain matrices. We close by discussing some applications of this more general point of view, including Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for neural decoding and efficient estimation of spatially-varying firing rates.},

abstract = {Neuronal oscillators can function as bistable toggle switches, flipping between quiescence and rhythmic firing in response to an input stimulus. In theory, such switching should be sensitive to small noisy inputs if the bistable states are in close proximity, which we test here using a perfused squid axon preparation. We find that small noisy stimulus currents induce a multitude of paths between two nearby stable states: repetitive firing and quiescence. The pattern of on-off switching of the pacemaker depends on the intensity, spectral properties, and phase angle of stimulus current fluctuations. Analysis by spike-triggered averaging of the stimulus currents near the transitions reveals that sinusoidal stimuli timed antiphase or in phase with repetitive firing correlates with switching of the pacemaker off or on, respectively. Our results reveal a distinct form of bistability in which noise can either silence pacemaker activity, trigger repetitive firing, or induce sporadic burst patterns similar to those recorded in a variety of normal and pathological neurons.},

title = {Numerical integration in the reconstruction of cardiac action potentials using Hodgkin-Huxley-type models},
abstract = {A comparison between traditional numerical integration methods and a new hybrid integration method for the reconstruction of action potential activity is presented, using a mathematical model of the cardiac Purkinje fiber (MNT model). It is shown that the hybrid integration method reduces importantly the overall computation time required for solving the Hodgkin-Huxley differential equations describing membrane electrical events. To accomplish this, the particular form of the gating variable equations is exploited to reformulate the step-by-step computation. In this way, the time increment can be made much larger compared with traditional methods when the membrane potential changes slowly. A mathematical analysis of the hybrid integration method is presented also, together with a numerical verification of its performance both for the propagated and nonpropagated membrane action potential. It is shown that the local error, that is the error arising at each integration step, and the cumulative integration error are strictly controlled by the membrane potential offset. Using the MNT model, the nonpropagated cardiac Purkinje action potential can be reconstructed in real time with an accuracy of 1% for the potential and 5% for the time of occurrence of its main features. In reconstructing propagated events, the hybrid integration method allows computation time savings by a factor of 10 or more compared to accurate Runge-Kutta schemes.},

abstract = {Purkinje cells ( PCs) integrate all computations performed in the cerebellar cortex to inhibit neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei ( DCN). Simple spikes recorded in vivo from pairs of PCs separated by < 100 mu m are known to be synchronized with a sharp peak riding on a broad peak, but the significance of this finding is unclear. We show that the sharp peak consists exclusively of simple spikes associated with pauses in firing. The broader, less precise peak was caused by firing-rate co-modulation of faster firing spikes. About 13% of all pauses were synchronized, and these pauses had a median duration of 20 ms. As in vitro studies have reported that synchronous pauses can reliably trigger spikes in DCN neurons, we suggest that the subgroup of spikes causing the sharp peak is important for precise temporal coding in the cerebellum.},

title = {Selective Participation of Somatodendritic HCN Channels in Inhibitory But Not Excitatory Synaptic Integration in Neurons of the Subthalamic Nucleus},
abstract = {The activity patterns of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons are intimately linked to motor function and dysfunction and arise through the complex interaction of intrinsic properties and inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs. In many neurons, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels play key roles in intrinsic excitability and synaptic integration both under normal conditions and in disease states. However, in STN neurons, which strongly express HCN channels, their roles remain relatively obscure. To address this deficit, complementary molecular and cellular electrophysiological, imaging, and computational approaches were applied to the rat STN. Molecular profiling demonstrated that individual STN neurons express mRNA encoding several HCN subunits, with HCN2 and 3 being the most abundant. Light and electron microscopic analysis showed that HCN2 subunits are strongly expressed and distributed throughout the somatodendritic plasma membrane. Voltage-, current-, and dynamic-clamp analysis, two-photon Ca(2+) imaging, and computational modeling revealed that HCN channels are activated by GABA(A) receptor-mediated inputs and thus limit synaptic hyperpolarization and deinactivation of low-voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels. Although HCN channels also limited the temporal summation of EPSPs, generated through two-photon uncaging of glutamate, this action was largely shunted by GABAergic inhibition that was necessary for HCN channel activation. Together the data demonstrate that HCN channels in STN neurons selectively counteract GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition arising from the globus pallidus and thus promote single-spike activity rather than rebound burst firing.},

title = {The Ca2+ dynamics of isolated mouse beta-cells and islets: implications for mathematical models},
abstract = {[Ca(2+)](i) and electrical activity were compared in isolated beta-cells and islets using standard techniques. In islets, raising glucose caused a decrease in [Ca(2+)](i) followed by a plateau and then fast (2-3 min(-1)), slow (0.2-0.8 min(-1)), or a mixture of fast and slow [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations. In beta-cells, glucose transiently decreased and then increased [Ca(2+)](i), but no islet-like oscillations occurred. Simultaneous recordings of [Ca(2+)](i) and electrical activity suggested that differences in [Ca(2+)](i) signaling are due to differences in islet versus beta-cell electrical activity. Whereas islets exhibited bursts of spikes on medium/slow plateaus, isolated beta-cells were depolarized and exhibited spiking, fast-bursting, or spikeless plateaus. These electrical patterns in turn produced distinct [Ca(2+)](i) patterns. Thus, although isolated beta-cells display several key features of islets, their oscillations were faster and more irregular. beta-cells could display islet-like [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations if their electrical activity was converted to a slower islet-like pattern using dynamic clamp. Islet and beta-cell [Ca(2+)](i) changes followed membrane potential, suggesting that electrical activity is mainly responsible for the [Ca(2+)] dynamics of beta-cells and islets. A recent model consisting of two slow feedback processes and passive endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release was able to account for islet [Ca(2+)](i) responses to glucose, islet oscillations, and conversion of single cell to islet-like [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations. With minimal parameter variation, the model could also account for the diverse behaviors of isolated beta-cells, suggesting that these behaviors reflect natural cell heterogeneity. These results support our recent model and point to the important role of beta-cell electrical events in controlling [Ca(2+)](i) over diverse time scales in islets.},

title = {Enhancement by T-type Ca2+ currents of odor sensitivity in olfactory receptor cells},
abstract = {Mechanisms underlying action potential initiation in olfactory receptor cells (ORCs) during odor stimulation were investigated using conventional and dynamic patch-clamp recording techniques. Under current-clamp conditions, action potentials generated by a least effective odor-induced depolarization were almost completely blocked by 0.1 mm Ni(2+), a T-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, but not by 0.1 mm Cd(2+), a high voltage-activated Ca(2+) channel blocker. Under voltage-clamp conditions, depolarizing voltage steps induced a fast transient inward current, which consisted of Na(+) (I(Na)) and T-type Ca(2+) (I(Ca,T)) currents. The amplitude of I(Ca,T) was approximately one-fourth of that of I(Na) (0.23 +/- 0.03, mean +/- SEM). Because both I(Na) and I(Ca,T) are known to show rapid inactivation, we examined how much I(Na) and I(Ca,T) are activated during the gradually depolarizing initial phase of receptor potentials. The ratio of I(Ca,T)/I(Na) during a ramp depolarization at the slope of 0.5 mV/msec was 0.56 +/- 0.03. Using the dynamic patch-clamp recording technique, we also recorded I(Ca,T) and I(Na) during the generation of odor-induced action potentials. This ratio of I(Ca,T)/I(Na) was 0.54 +/- 0.04. These ratios were more than twice as large as that (0.23) obtained from the experiment using voltage steps, suggesting that I(Ca,T) carries significant amount of current to generate the action potentials. We conclude that I(Ca,T) contributes to enhance odor sensitivity by lowering the threshold of spike generation in ORCs.},

title = {Different responses of rat cerebellar Purkinje cells and Golgi cells evoked by widespread convergent sensory inputs},
abstract = {While the synaptic properties of Golgi cell-mediated inhibition of granule cells are well studied, less is known of the afferent inputs to Golgi cells so their role in information processing remains unclear. We investigated the responses of cerebellar cortical Golgi cells and Purkinje cells in Crus I and II of the posterior lobe cerebellar hemisphere to activation of peripheral afferents in vivo, using anaesthetized rats. Recordings were made from 70 Golgi cells and 76 Purkinje cells. Purkinje cells were identified by the presence of climbing fibre responses. Golgi cells were identified by both spontaneous firing pattern and response properties, and identification was confirmed using juxtacellular labelling of single neurones (n = 16). Purkinje cells in Crus II showed continuous firing at relatively high rates (25-60 Hz) and stimulation of peripheral afferents rarely evoked substantial responses. The most common response was a modest, long-latency, long-lasting increase in simple spike output. By comparison, the most common response evoked in Golgi cells by the same stimuli was a long-latency, long-lasting depression of firing, found in approximately 70% of the Golgi cells tested. The onsets of Golgi cell depressions had shorter latencies than the Purkinje cell excitations. Brief, short-latency excitations and reductions in firing were also evoked in some Golgi cells, and rarely in Purkinje cells, but in most cases long-lasting depressions were the only significant change in spike firing. Golgi cell responses could be evoked using air puff or tactile stimuli and under four different anaesthetic regimens. Long-lasting responses in both neurone types could be evoked from wide receptive fields, in many cases including distal afferents from all four limbs, as well as from trigeminal afferents. These Golgi cell responses are not consistent with the conventional feedback inhibition or 'gain control' models of Golgi cell function. They suggest instead that cerebellar cortical activity can be powerfully modulated by the general level of peripheral afferent activation from much of the body. On this basis, Golgi cells may act as a context-specific gate on transmission through the mossy fibre-granule cell pathway.},
